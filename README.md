# BD-CourseWork
Big Data course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Objectives
In many scientific fields, such as biology or environmental sciences, the rapid evolution of scientific instruments and the
intensive use of computer simulation have led to a significant production of data. Scientific applications are faced with new
problems, mainly linked to the storage and exploitation of this data.
This course will explore the major issues raised by the emergence of these data flows (storage, interrogation, analysis and
visualization), and will look at some of the technological solutions currently in use. The ethical and legal issues raised by the
collection and use of this data will also be examined.

## Keywords 
Big Data, Data scientist, NoSQL, Hadoop, Big Data analytics, Open Data, Linked open data, GIS
