pm	1
on	1
1st	1
may	1
arriving	1
at	1
vienna	1
early	1
next	1
morning	1
should	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
646	1
but	1
train	1
was	1
an	1
hour	1
late	1
budapesth	1
seems	1
a	1
wonderful	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
glimpse	1
which	1
i	1
got	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
train	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
i	1
could	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
go	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
station	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
arrived	1
late	1
and	1
would	1
start	1
as	1
near	1
the	1
correct	1
time	1
as	1
possible	1
the	1
impression	1
i	1
had	1
was	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
leaving	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
east	1
the	1
most	1
western	1
of	1
splendid	1
bridges	1
over	1
the	1
danube	1
which	1
is	1
here	1
of	1
noble	1
width	1
and	1
depth	1
took	1
us	1
among	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
turkish	1
rule	1
we	1
left	1
in	1
pretty	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
came	1
after	1
nightfall	1
to	1
klausenburgh	1
here	1
i	1
stopped	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
hotel	1
royale	1
i	1
had	1
for	1
dinner	1
or	1
rather	1
supper	1
a	1
chicken	1
done	1
up	1
some	1
way	1
with	1
red	1
pepper	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
thirsty	1
mem	1
get	1
recipe	1
for	1
mina	1
i	1
asked	1
the	1
waiter	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
paprika	1
hendl	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
national	1
dish	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
anywhere	1
along	1
the	1
carpathians	1
i	1
found	1
my	1
smattering	1
of	1
german	1
very	1
useful	1
here	1
indeed	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
how	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
without	1
it	1
having	1
had	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
my	1
disposal	1
when	1
in	1
london	1
i	1
had	1
visited	1
the	1
british	1
museum	1
and	1
made	1
search	1
among	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
maps	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
regarding	1
transylvania	1
it	1
had	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
some	1
importance	1
in	1
dealing	1
with	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
i	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
district	1
he	1
named	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
extreme	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
just	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
three	1
states	1
transylvania	1
moldavia	1
and	1
bukovina	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
carpathian	1
mountains	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wildest	1
and	1
least	1
known	1
portions	1
of	1
europe	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
light	1
on	1
any	1
map	1
or	1
work	1
giving	1
the	1
exact	1
locality	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
dracula	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
maps	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
as	1
yet	1
to	1
compare	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
ordnance	1
survey	1
maps	1
but	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
bistritz	1
the	1
post	1
town	1
named	1
by	1
count	1
dracula	1
is	1
a	1
fairly	1
wellknown	1
place	1
i	1
shall	1
enter	1
here	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
notes	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
refresh	1
my	1
memory	1
when	1
i	1
talk	1
over	1
my	1
travels	1
with	1
mina	1
in	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
transylvania	1
there	1
are	1
four	1
distinct	1
nationalities	1
saxons	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
mixed	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
wallachs	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
descendants	1
of	1
the	1
dacians	1
magyars	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
szekelys	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
north	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
among	1
the	1
latter	1
who	1
claim	1
to	1
be	1
descended	1
from	1
attila	1
and	1
the	1
huns	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
magyars	1
conquered	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
century	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
huns	1
settled	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
read	1
that	1
every	1
known	1
superstition	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
gathered	1
into	1
the	1
horseshoe	1
of	1
the	1
carpathians	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
imaginative	1
whirlpool	1
if	1
so	1
my	1
stay	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
interesting	1
mem	1
i	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
count	1
all	1
about	1
them	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
well	1
though	1
my	1
bed	1
was	1
comfortable	1
enough	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
queer	1
dreams	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dog	1
howling	1
all	1
night	1
under	1
my	1
window	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
paprika	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
drink	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
water	1
in	1
my	1
carafe	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
thirsty	1
towards	1
morning	1
i	1
slept	1
and	1
was	1
wakened	1
by	1
the	1
continuous	1
knocking	1
at	1
my	1
door	1
so	1
i	1
guess	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
then	1
i	1
had	1
for	1
breakfast	1
more	1
paprika	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
porridge	1
of	1
maize	1
flour	1
which	1
they	1
said	1
was	1
mamaliga	1
and	1
eggplant	1
stuffed	1
with	1
forcemeat	1
a	1
very	1
excellent	1
dish	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
impletata	1
mem	1
get	1
recipe	1
for	1
this	1
also	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
hurry	1
breakfast	1
for	1
the	1
train	1
started	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
eight	1
or	1
rather	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
for	1
after	1
rushing	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
at	1
730	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
further	1
east	1
you	1
go	1
the	1
more	1
unpunctual	1
are	1
the	1
trains	1
what	1
ought	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
china	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
we	1
seemed	1
to	1
dawdle	1
through	1
a	1
country	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
beauty	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
sometimes	1
we	1
saw	1
little	1
towns	1
or	1
castles	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
steep	1
hills	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
old	1
missals	1
sometimes	1
we	1
ran	1
by	1
rivers	1
and	1
streams	1
which	1
seemed	1
from	1
the	1
wide	1
stony	1
margin	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
great	1
floods	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
running	1
strong	1
to	1
sweep	1
the	1
outside	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
river	1
clear	1
at	1
every	1
station	1
there	1
were	1
groups	1
of	1
people	1
sometimes	1
crowds	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
attire	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
peasants	1
at	1
home	1
or	1
those	1
i	1
saw	1
coming	1
through	1
france	1
and	1
germany	1
with	1
short	1
jackets	1
and	1
round	1
hats	1
and	1
homemade	1
trousers	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
very	1
picturesque	1
the	1
women	1
looked	1
pretty	1
except	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
near	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
clumsy	1
about	1
the	1
waist	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
full	1
white	1
sleeves	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
or	1
other	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
big	1
belts	1
with	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
strips	1
of	1
something	1
fluttering	1
from	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
dresses	1
in	1
a	1
ballet	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
were	1
petticoats	1
under	1
them	1
the	1
strangest	1
figures	1
we	1
saw	1
were	1
the	1
slovaks	1
who	1
were	1
more	1
barbarian	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
with	1
their	1
big	1
cowboy	1
hats	1
great	1
baggy	1
dirtywhite	1
trousers	1
white	1
linen	1
shirts	1
and	1
enormous	1
heavy	1
leather	1
belts	1
nearly	1
a	1
foot	1
wide	1
all	1
studded	1
over	1
with	1
brass	1
nails	1
they	1
wore	1
high	1
boots	1
with	1
their	1
trousers	1
tucked	1
into	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
heavy	1
black	1
moustaches	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
picturesque	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
look	1
prepossessing	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
some	1
old	1
oriental	1
band	1
of	1
brigands	1
they	1
are	1
however	1
i	1
am	1
told	1
very	1
harmless	1
and	1
rather	1
wanting	1
in	1
natural	1
selfassertion	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
side	1
of	1
twilight	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
bistritz	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
old	1
place	1
being	1
practically	1
on	1
the	1
frontier	1
for	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
leads	1
from	1
it	1
into	1
bukovina	1
it	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
stormy	1
existence	1
and	1
it	1
certainly	1
shows	1
marks	1
of	1
it	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
great	1
fires	1
took	1
place	1
which	1
made	1
terrible	1
havoc	1
on	1
five	1
separate	1
occasions	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
century	1
it	1
underwent	1
a	1
siege	1
of	1
three	1
weeks	1
and	1
lost	1
13000	1
people	1
the	1
casualties	1
of	1
war	1
proper	1
being	1
assisted	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
disease	1
count	1
dracula	1
had	1
directed	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
golden	1
krone	1
hotel	1
which	1
i	1
found	1
to	1
my	1
great	1
delight	1
to	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
oldfashioned	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
was	1
evidently	1
expected	1
for	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
faced	1
a	1
cheerylooking	1
elderly	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
peasant	1
dresswhite	1
undergarment	1
with	1
long	1
double	1
apron	1
front	1
and	1
back	1
of	1
coloured	1
stuff	1
fitting	1
almost	1
too	1
tight	1
for	1
modesty	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
close	1
she	1
bowed	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
herr	1
englishman	1
yes	1
i	1
said	1
jonathan	1
harker	1
she	1
smiled	1
and	1
gave	1
some	1
message	1
to	1
an	1
elderly	1
man	1
in	1
white	1
shirtsleeves	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
went	1
but	1
immediately	1
returned	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
my	1
friend	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
carpathians	1
i	1
am	1
anxiously	1
expecting	1
you	1
sleep	1
well	1
tonight	1
at	1
three	1
tomorrow	1

diligence	1
will	1
start	1
for	1
bukovina	1
a	1
place	1
on	1
it	1
is	1
kept	1
for	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
my	1
carriage	1
will	1
await	1
you	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
trust	1
that	1
your	1
journey	1
from	1
london	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
happy	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
enjoy	1
your	1
stay	1
in	1
my	1
beautiful	1
land	1
your	1
friend	1
dracula	1
4	1
may	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
my	1
landlord	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
count	1
directing	1
him	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
coach	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
on	1
making	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
details	1
he	1
seemed	1
somewhat	1
reticent	1
and	1
pretended	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
my	1
german	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
true	1
because	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
it	1
perfectly	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
answered	1
my	1
questions	1
exactly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
received	1
me	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
he	1
mumbled	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
when	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
count	1
dracula	1
and	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
anything	1
of	1
his	1
castle	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
and	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
simply	1
refused	1
to	1
speak	1
further	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
starting	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
mysterious	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
comforting	1
just	1
before	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
hysterical	1
way	1
must	1
you	1
go	1
oh	1
young	1
herr	1
must	1
you	1
go	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
excited	1
state	1
that	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
her	1
grip	1
of	1
what	1
german	1
she	1
knew	1
and	1
mixed	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
language	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
was	1
just	1
able	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
by	1
asking	1
many	1
questions	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
engaged	1
on	1
important	1
business	1
she	1
asked	1
again	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
answered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
may	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
again	1
oh	1
yes	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
saying	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
st	1
georges	1
day	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
tonight	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
strikes	1
midnight	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
have	1
full	1
sway	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
evident	1
distress	1
that	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
but	1
without	1
effect	1
finally	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
implored	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
wait	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
before	1
starting	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
ridiculous	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
comfortable	1
how	1
ever	1
there	1
was	1
business	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
allow	1
nothing	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
therefore	1
tried	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
as	1
gravely	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
that	1
i	1
thanked	1
her	1
but	1
my	1
duty	1
was	1
imperative	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
she	1
then	1
rose	1
and	1
dried	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
crucifix	1
from	1
her	1
neck	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
as	1
an	1
english	1
churchman	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
regard	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
idolatrous	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
ungracious	1
to	1
refuse	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
meaning	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
she	1
saw	1
i	1
suppose	1
the	1
doubt	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
for	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
rosary	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
mothers	1
sake	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
am	1
writing	1
up	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
diary	1
whilst	1
i	1
am	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coach	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
late	1
and	1
the	1
crucifix	1
is	1
still	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
ladys	1
fear	1
or	1
the	1
many	1
ghostly	1
traditions	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
or	1
the	1
crucifix	1
itself	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
feeling	1
nearly	1
as	1
easy	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
as	1
usual	1
if	1
this	1
book	1
should	1
ever	1
reach	1
mina	1
before	1
i	1
do	1
let	1
it	1
bring	1
my	1
goodbye	1
here	1
comes	1
the	1
coach	1
5	1
may	1
the	1
castle	1
the	1
grey	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
has	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
distant	1
horizon	1
which	1
seems	1
jagged	1
whether	1
with	1
trees	1
or	1
hills	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
that	1
big	1
things	1
and	1
little	1
are	1
mixed	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
sleepy	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
till	1
i	1
awake	1
naturally	1
i	1
write	1
till	1
sleep	1
comes	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
odd	1
things	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
and	1
lest	1
who	1
reads	1
them	1
may	1
fancy	1
that	1
i	1
dined	1
too	1
well	1
before	1
i	1
left	1
bistritz	1
let	1
me	1
put	1
down	1
my	1
dinner	1
exactly	1
i	1
dined	1
on	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
robber	1
steak	1
bits	1
of	1
bacon	1
onion	1
and	1
beef	1
seasoned	1
with	1
red	1
pepper	1
and	1
strung	1
on	1
sticks	1
and	1
roasted	1
over	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
simple	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
london	1
cats	1
meat	1
the	1
wine	1
was	1
golden	1
mediasch	1
which	1
produces	1
a	1
queer	1
sting	1
on	1
the	1
tongue	1
which	1
is	1
however	1
not	1
disagreeable	1
i	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
glasses	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
nothing	1
else	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
on	1
the	1
coach	1
the	1
driver	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
talking	1
with	1
the	1
landlady	1
they	1
were	1
evidently	1
talking	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
by	1
a	1
name	1
meaning	1
wordbearer	1
came	1
and	1
listened	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
pityingly	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
words	1
often	1
repeated	1
queer	1
words	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
nationalities	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
so	1
i	1
quietly	1
got	1
my	1
polyglot	1
dictionary	1
from	1
my	1
bag	1
and	1
looked	1
them	1
out	1
i	1
must	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
cheering	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
amongst	1
them	1
were	1
ordog	1
satan	1
pokol	1
hell	1
stregoica	1
witch	1
vrolok	1
and	1
vlkoslak	1
both	1
of	1
which	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
one	1
being	1
slovak	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
servian	1
for	1
something	1
that	1
is	1
either	1
werewolf	1
or	1
vampire	1
mem	1
i	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
count	1
about	1
these	1
superstitions	1
when	1
we	1
started	1
the	1
crowd	1
round	1
the	1
inn	1
door	1
which	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
swelled	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
size	1
all	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
pointed	1
two	1
fingers	1
towards	1
me	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
fellowpassenger	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
they	1
meant	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
answer	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
english	1
he	1
explained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
charm	1
or	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
evil	1
eye	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
pleasant	1
for	1
me	1
just	1
starting	1
for	1
an	1
unknown	1
place	1
to	1
meet	1
an	1
unknown	1
man	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
seemed	1
so	1
kindhearted	1
and	1
so	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
so	1
sympathetic	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
touched	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
last	1
glimpse	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
innyard	1
and	1
its	1
crowd	1
of	1
picturesque	1
figures	1
all	1
crossing	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
wide	1
archway	1
with	1
its	1
background	1
of	1
rich	1
foliage	1
of	1
oleander	1
and	1
orange	1
trees	1
in	1
green	1
tubs	1
clustered	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
then	1
our	1
driver	1
whose	1
wide	1
linen	1
drawers	1
covered	1
the	1
whole	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
boxseat	1
gotza	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
cracked	1
his	1
big	1
whip	1
over	1
his	1
four	1
small	1
horses	1
which	1
ran	1
abreast	1
and	1
we	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
i	1
soon	1
lost	1
sight	1
and	1
recollection	1
of	1
ghostly	1
fears	1
in	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
as	1
we	1
drove	1
along	1
although	1
had	1
i	1
known	1
the	1
language	1
or	1
rather	1
languages	1
which	1
my	1
fellowpassengers	1
were	1
speaking	1
i	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
off	1
so	1
easily	1
before	1
us	1
lay	1
a	1
green	1
sloping	1
land	1
full	1
of	1
forests	1
and	1
woods	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
steep	1
hills	1
crowned	1
with	1
clumps	1
of	1
trees	1
or	1
with	1
farmhouses	1
the	1
blank	1
gable	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
there	1
was	1
everywhere	1
a	1
bewildering	1
mass	1
of	1
fruit	1
blossom	1
apple	1
plum	1
pear	1
cherry	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
drove	1
by	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
green	1
grass	1
under	1
the	1
trees	1
spangled	1
with	1
the	1
fallen	1
petals	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
amongst	1
these	1
green	1
hills	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
here	1
the	1
mittel	1
land	1
ran	1
the	1
road	1
losing	1
itself	1
as	1
it	1
swept	1
round	1
the	1
grassy	1
curve	1
or	1
was	1
shut	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
straggling	1
ends	1
of	1
pine	1
woods	1
which	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
hillsides	1
like	1
tongues	1
of	1
flame	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
rugged	1
but	1
still	1
we	1
seemed	1
to	1
fly	1
over	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
haste	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
then	1
what	1
the	1
haste	1
meant	1
but	1
the	1
driver	1
was	1
evidently	1
bent	1
on	1
losing	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
reaching	1
borgo	1
prund	1
i	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
this	1
road	1
is	1
in	1
summertime	1
excellent	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
order	1
after	1
the	1
winter	1
snows	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
it	1
is	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
run	1
of	1
roads	1
in	1
the	1
carpathians	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
tradition	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
too	1
good	1
order	1
of	1

so	1
hasten	1
the	1

at	1

of	1
the	1

themselves	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
us	1
they	1
towered	1
with	1
the	1
afternoon	1
sun	1
falling	1
full	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
bringing	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
glorious	1
colours	1
of	1
this	1
beautiful	1
range	1
deep	1
blue	1
and	1
purple	1
in	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
peaks	1
green	1
and	1
brown	1
where	1
grass	1
and	1

mingled	1
and	1
an	1
endless	1
perspective	1
of	1
jagged	1
rock	1
and	1
pointed	1
crags	1
till	1
these	1
were	1
themselves	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
where	1
the	1
snowy	1
peaks	1
rose	1
grandly	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
mighty	1
rifts	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
through	1
which	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
sink	1
we	1
saw	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
white	1
gleam	1
of	1
falling	1
water	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
companions	1
touched	1
my	1
arm	1
as	1
we	1
swept	1
round	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
a	1
hill	1
and	1
opened	1
up	1
the	1
lofty	1
snowcovered	1
peak	1
of	1
a	1
mountain	1
which	1
seemed	1
as	1
we	1
wound	1
on	1
our	1
serpentine	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
before	1
us	1
look	1

and	1
he	1
crossed	1
himself	1
reverently	1
as	1
we	1
wound	1
on	1
our	1
endless	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
sank	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
behind	1
us	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
began	1
to	1
creep	1
round	1
us	1
this	1
was	1
emphasised	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
snowy	1
mountaintop	1
still	1
held	1
the	1
sunset	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
glow	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
delicate	1
cool	1
pink	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
passed	1
cszeks	1
and	1
slovaks	1
all	1
in	1
picturesque	1
attire	1
but	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
goitre	1
was	1
painfully	1
prevalent	1
by	1
the	1
roadside	1
were	1
many	1
crosses	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
swept	1
by	1
my	1
companions	1
all	1
crossed	1
themselves	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
kneeling	1
before	1
a	1
shrine	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
turn	1
round	1
as	1
we	1
approached	1
but	1
seemed	1
in	1
the	1
selfsurrender	1
of	1
devotion	1
to	1
have	1
neither	1
eyes	1
nor	1
ears	1
for	1
the	1
outer	1
world	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
things	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
instance	1
hayricks	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
very	1
beautiful	1
masses	1
of	1
weeping	1
birch	1
their	1
white	1
stems	1
shining	1
like	1
silver	1
through	1
the	1
delicate	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
leaves	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
we	1
passed	1
a	1
leiterwagon	1
the	1
ordinary	1
peasants	1
cart	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
snakelike	1
vertebra	1
calculated	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
inequalities	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
on	1
this	1
were	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
quite	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
homecoming	1
peasants	1
the	1
cszeks	1
with	1
their	1
white	1
and	1
the	1
slovaks	1
with	1
their	1
coloured	1
sheepskins	1
the	1
latter	1
carrying	1
lancefashion	1
their	1
long	1
staves	1
with	1
axe	1
at	1
end	1
as	1
the	1
evening	1
fell	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
very	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
growing	1
twilight	1
seemed	1
to	1
merge	1
into	1
one	1
dark	1
mistiness	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
oak	1
beech	1
and	1
pine	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
which	1
ran	1
deep	1
between	1
the	1
spurs	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
as	1
we	1
ascended	1
through	1
the	1
pass	1
the	1
dark	1
firs	1
stood	1
out	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
against	1
the	1
background	1
of	1
latelying	1
snow	1
sometimes	1
as	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
cut	1
through	1
the	1
pine	1
woods	1
that	1
seemed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
to	1
be	1
closing	1
down	1
upon	1
us	1
great	1
masses	1
of	1
greyness	1
which	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
bestrewed	1
the	1
trees	1
produced	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
weird	1
and	1
solemn	1
effect	1
which	1
carried	1
on	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
grim	1
fancies	1
engendered	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
failing	1
sunset	1
threw	1
into	1
strange	1
relief	1
the	1
ghostlike	1
clouds	1
which	1
amongst	1
the	1
carpathians	1
seem	1
to	1
wind	1
ceaselessly	1
through	1
the	1
valleys	1
sometimes	1
the	1
hills	1
were	1
so	1
steep	1
that	1
despite	1
our	1
drivers	1
haste	1
the	1
horses	1
could	1
only	1
go	1
slowly	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
down	1
and	1
walk	1
up	1
them	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
at	1
home	1
but	1
the	1
driver	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
no	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
walk	1
here	1
the	1
dogs	1
are	1
too	1
fierce	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
evidently	1
meant	1
for	1
grim	1
pleasantry	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
approving	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
enough	1
of	1
such	1
matters	1
before	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
the	1
only	1
stop	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
was	1
a	1
moments	1
pause	1
to	1
light	1
his	1
lamps	1
when	1
it	1
grew	1
dark	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
excitement	1
amongst	1
the	1
passengers	1
and	1
they	1
kept	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
though	1
urging	1
him	1
to	1
further	1
speed	1
he	1
lashed	1
the	1
horses	1
unmercifully	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
whip	1
and	1
with	1
wild	1
cries	1
of	1
encouragement	1
urged	1
them	1
on	1
to	1
further	1
exertions	1
then	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
patch	1
of	1
grey	1
light	1
ahead	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
cleft	1
in	1
the	1
hills	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
passengers	1
grew	1
greater	1
the	1
crazy	1
coach	1
rocked	1
on	1
its	1
great	1
leather	1
springs	1
and	1
swayed	1
like	1
a	1
boat	1
tossed	1
on	1
a	1
stormy	1
sea	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
grew	1
more	1
level	1
and	1
we	1
appeared	1
to	1
fly	1
along	1
then	1
the	1
mountains	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
us	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
and	1
to	1
frown	1
down	1
upon	1
us	1
we	1
were	1
entering	1
on	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
passengers	1
offered	1
me	1
gifts	1
which	1
they	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
an	1
earnestness	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
no	1
denial	1
these	1
were	1
certainly	1
of	1
an	1
odd	1
and	1
varied	1
kind	1
but	1
each	1
was	1
given	1
in	1
simple	1
good	1
faith	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
word	1
and	1
a	1
blessing	1
and	1
that	1
strange	1
mixture	1
of	1
fearmeaning	1
movements	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
outside	1
the	1
hotel	1
at	1
bistritz	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
the	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
evil	1
eye	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
flew	1
along	1
the	1
driver	1
leaned	1
forward	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
the	1
passengers	1
craning	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
peered	1
eagerly	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
something	1
very	1
exciting	1
was	1
either	1
happening	1
or	1
expected	1
but	1
though	1
i	1
asked	1
each	1
passenger	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
slightest	1
explanation	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
kept	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
we	1
saw	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
pass	1
opening	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
eastern	1
side	1
there	1
were	1
dark	1
rolling	1
clouds	1
overhead	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
heavy	1
oppressive	1
sense	1
of	1
thunder	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
mountain	1
range	1
had	1
separated	1
two	1
atmospheres	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
we	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
thunderous	1
one	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
myself	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
conveyance	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
each	1
moment	1
i	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
lamps	1
through	1
the	1
blackness	1
but	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
the	1
only	1
light	1
was	1
the	1
flickering	1
rays	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
lamps	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
steam	1
from	1
our	1
harddriven	1
horses	1
rose	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
cloud	1
we	1
could	1
now	1
see	1
the	1
sandy	1
road	1
lying	1
white	1
before	1
us	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
it	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
vehicle	1
the	1
passengers	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
gladness	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
mock	1
my	1
own	1
disappointment	1
i	1
was	1
already	1
thinking	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
best	1
do	1
when	1
the	1
driver	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
something	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
hear	1
it	1
was	1
spoken	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
low	1
a	1
tone	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
hour	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
time	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
german	1
worse	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
carriage	1
here	1
the	1
herr	1
is	1
not	1
expected	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
will	1
now	1
come	1
on	1
to	1
bukovina	1
and	1
return	1
tomorrow	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
better	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
neigh	1
and	1
snort	1
and	1
plunge	1
wildly	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
driver	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
them	1
up	1
then	1
amongst	1
a	1
chorus	1
of	1
screams	1
from	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
a	1
universal	1
crossing	1
of	1
themselves	1
a	1
caleche	1
with	1
four	1
horses	1
drove	1
up	1
behind	1
us	1
overtook	1
us	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
beside	1
the	1
coach	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1
our	1
lamps	1
as	1
the	1
rays	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
coalblack	1
and	1
splendid	1
animals	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
brown	1
beard	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
black	1
hat	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
us	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
very	1
bright	1
eyes	1
which	1
seemed	1
red	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
us	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
you	1
are	1
early	1
tonight	1
my	1
friend	1
the	1
man	1
stammered	1
in	1
reply	1
the	1
english	1
herr	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
replied	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
bukovina	1
you	1
cannot	1
deceive	1
me	1
my	1
friend	1
i	1
know	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
my	1
horses	1
are	1
swift	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
lamplight	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
hardlooking	1
mouth	1
with	1
very	1
red	1
lips	1
and	1
sharplooking	1
teeth	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
ivory	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
companions	1
whispered	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
line	1
from	1
burgers	1
lenore	1
denn	1

schnell	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
travel	1
fast	1
the	1
strange	1
driver	1
evidently	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
gleaming	1
smile	1
the	1
passenger	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
two	1
fingers	1
and	1
crossing	1
himself	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
herrs	1
luggage	1
said	1
the	1
driver	1
and	1
with	1
exceeding	1
alacrity	1
my	1
bags	1
were	1
handed	1
out	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
caleche	1
then	1
i	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
as	1
the	1
caleche	1
was	1
close	1
alongside	1
the	1
driver	1
helping	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
which	1
caught	1
my	1
arm	1
in	1
a	1
grip	1
of	1
steel	1
his	1
strength	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
prodigious	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
reins	1
the	1
horses	1
turned	1
and	1
we	1
swept	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
pass	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
back	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
steam	1
from	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamps	1
and	1
projected	1
against	1
it	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
my	1
late	1
companions	1
crossing	1
themselves	1
then	1
the	1
driver	1
cracked	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
off	1
they	1
swept	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
bukovina	1
as	1
they	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
strange	1
chill	1
and	1
a	1
lonely	1
feeling	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
cloak	1
was	1
thrown	1
over	1
my	1
shoulders	1
and	1
a	1
rug	1
across	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
the	1
driver	1
said	1
in	1
excellent	1
german	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
chill	1
mein	1
herr	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
the	1
count	1
bade	1
me	1
take	1
all	1
care	1
of	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
flask	1
of	1
slivovitz	1
the	1
plum	1
brandy	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
underneath	1
the	1
seat	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
require	1
it	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
strangely	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
frightened	1
i	1
think	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
any	1
alternative	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
instead	1
of	1
prosecuting	1
that	1
unknown	1
night	1
journey	1
the	1
carriage	1
went	1
at	1
a	1
hard	1
pace	1
straight	1
along	1
then	1
we	1
made	1
a	1
complete	1
turn	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
another	1
straight	1
road	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
simply	1
going	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
ground	1
again	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
took	1
note	1
of	1
some	1
salient	1
point	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
asked	1
the	1
driver	1
what	1
this	1
all	1
meant	1
but	1
i	1
really	1
feared	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
for	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
placed	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
any	1
protest	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
in	1
case	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
intention	1
to	1
delay	1
byandby	1
however	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
time	1
was	1
passing	1
i	1
struck	1
a	1
match	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
flame	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
watch	1
it	1
was	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
midnight	1
this	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shock	1
for	1
i	1
suppose	1
the	1
general	1
superstition	1
about	1
midnight	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
my	1
recent	1
experiences	1
i	1
waited	1
with	1
a	1
sick	1
feeling	1
of	1
suspense	1
then	1
a	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
howl	1
somewhere	1
in	1
a	1
farmhouse	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
a	1
long	1
agonised	1
wailing	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
fear	1
the	1
sound	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
another	1
dog	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
and	1
another	1
till	1
borne	1
on	1
the	1
wind	1
which	1
now	1
sighed	1
softly	1
through	1
the	1
pass	1
a	1
wild	1
howling	1
began	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
imagination	1
could	1
grasp	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
howl	1
the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
strain	1
and	1
rear	1
but	1
the	1
driver	1
spoke	1
to	1
them	1
soothingly	1
and	1
they	1
quieted	1
down	1
but	1
shivered	1
and	1
sweated	1
as	1
though	1
after	1
a	1
runaway	1
from	1
sudden	1
fright	1
then	1
far	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
mountains	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
us	1
began	1
a	1
louder	1
and	1
a	1
sharper	1
howling	1
that	1
of	1
wolves	1
which	1
affected	1
both	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
jump	1
from	1
the	1
caleche	1
and	1
run	1
whilst	1
they	1
reared	1
again	1
and	1
plunged	1
madly	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
driver	1
had	1
to	1
use	1
all	1
his	1
great	1
strength	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
bolting	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
however	1
my	1
own	1
ears	1
got	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
so	1
far	1
became	1
quiet	1
that	1
the	1
driver	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
descend	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
them	1
he	1
petted	1
and	1
soothed	1
them	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
in	1
their	1
ears	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
horsetamers	1
doing	1
and	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
effect	1
for	1
under	1
his	1
caresses	1
they	1
became	1
quite	1
manageable	1
again	1
though	1
they	1
still	1
trembled	1
the	1
driver	1
again	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
reins	1
started	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
pace	1
this	1
time	1
after	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pass	1
he	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
down	1
a	1
narrow	1
roadway	1
which	1
ran	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
soon	1
we	1
were	1
hemmed	1
in	1
with	1
trees	1
which	1
in	1
places	1
arched	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
roadway	1
till	1
we	1
passed	1
as	1
through	1
a	1
tunnel	1
and	1
again	1
great	1
frowning	1
rocks	1
guarded	1
us	1
boldly	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
though	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
shelter	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
rising	1
wind	1
for	1
it	1
moaned	1
and	1
whistled	1
through	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
crashed	1
together	1
as	1
we	1
swept	1
along	1
it	1
grew	1
colder	1
and	1
colder	1
still	1
and	1
fine	1
powdery	1
snow	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
so	1
that	1
soon	1
we	1
and	1
all	1
around	1
us	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
blanket	1
the	1
keen	1
wind	1
still	1
carried	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
though	1
this	1
grew	1
fainter	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
the	1
baying	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
sounded	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
closing	1
round	1
on	1
us	1
from	1
every	1
side	1
i	1
grew	1
dreadfully	1
afraid	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
shared	1
my	1
fear	1
the	1
driver	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disturbed	1
he	1
kept	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
anything	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
suddenly	1
away	1
on	1
our	1
left	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
faint	1
flickering	1
blue	1
flame	1
the	1
driver	1
saw	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
checked	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
jumping	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
less	1
as	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
grew	1
closer	1
but	1
while	1
i	1
wondered	1
the	1
driver	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
again	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
we	1
resumed	1
our	1
journey	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
and	1
kept	1
dreaming	1
of	1
the	1
incident	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
repeated	1
endlessly	1
and	1
now	1
looking	1
back	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
awful	1
nightmare	1
once	1
the	1
flame	1
appeared	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
road	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
around	1
us	1
i	1
could	1
watch	1
the	1
drivers	1
motions	1
he	1
went	1
rapidly	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
blue	1
flame	1
arose	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
faint	1
for	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
illumine	1
the	1
place	1
around	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
gathering	1
a	1
few	1
stones	1
formed	1
them	1
into	1
some	1
device	1
once	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
strange	1
optical	1
effect	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
obstruct	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
its	1
ghostly	1
flicker	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
this	1
startled	1
me	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
only	1
momentary	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
deceived	1
me	1
straining	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
then	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
blue	1
flames	1
and	1
we	1
sped	1
onwards	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
with	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
around	1
us	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
following	1
in	1
a	1
moving	1
circle	1
at	1
last	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
driver	1
went	1
further	1
afield	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
gone	1
and	1
during	1
his	1
absence	1
the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
worse	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
to	1
snort	1
and	1
scream	1
with	1
fright	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
cause	1
for	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
had	1
ceased	1
altogether	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
moon	1
sailing	1
through	1
the	1
black	1
clouds	1
appeared	1
behind	1
the	1
jagged	1
crest	1
of	1
a	1
beetling	1
pineclad	1
rock	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
light	1
i	1
saw	1
around	1
us	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
wolves	1
with	1
white	1
teeth	1
and	1
lolling	1
red	1
tongues	1
with	1
long	1
sinewy	1
limbs	1
and	1
shaggy	1
hair	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
more	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
grim	1
silence	1
which	1
held	1
them	1
than	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
howled	1
for	1
myself	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
paralysis	1
of	1
fear	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
himself	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
such	1
horrors	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
under	1
stand	1
their	1
true	1
import	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
wolves	1
began	1
to	1
howl	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
moonlight	1
had	1
had	1
some	1
peculiar	1
effect	1
on	1
them	1
the	1
horses	1
jumped	1
about	1
and	1
reared	1
and	1
looked	1
helplessly	1
round	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
rolled	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
painful	1
to	1
see	1
but	1
the	1
living	1
ring	1
of	1
terror	1
encompassed	1
them	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
perforce	1
to	1
remain	1
within	1
it	1
i	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
only	1
chance	1
was	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
ring	1
and	1
to	1
aid	1
his	1
approach	1
i	1
shouted	1
and	1
beat	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
caleche	1
hoping	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
to	1
scare	1
the	1
wolves	1
from	1
that	1
side	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
reaching	1
the	1
trap	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
there	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
i	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
raised	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
imperious	1
command	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
sound	1
saw	1
him	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
roadway	1
as	1
he	1
swept	1
his	1
long	1
arms	1
as	1
though	1
brushing	1
aside	1
some	1
impalpable	1
obstacle	1
the	1
wolves	1
fell	1
back	1
and	1
back	1
further	1
still	1
just	1
then	1
a	1
heavy	1
cloud	1
passed	1
across	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
again	1
in	1
darkness	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
again	1
the	1
driver	1
was	1
climbing	1
into	1
the	1
caleche	1
and	1
the	1
wolves	1
had	1
disappeared	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
strange	1
and	1
uncanny	1
that	1
a	1
dreadful	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
move	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
interminable	1
as	1
we	1
swept	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
now	1
in	1
almost	1
complete	1
darkness	1
for	1
the	1
rolling	1
clouds	1
obscured	1
the	1
moon	1
we	1
kept	1
on	1
ascending	1
with	1
occasional	1
periods	1
of	1
quick	1
descent	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
always	1
ascending	1
suddenly	1
i	1
became	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
driver	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
pulling	1
up	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
a	1
vast	1
ruined	1
castle	1
from	1
whose	1
tall	1
black	1
windows	1
came	1
no	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
whose	1
broken	1
battlements	1
showed	1
a	1
jagged	1
line	1
against	1
the	1
moonlit	1
sky	1

the	1

of	1
such	1
a	1
remarkable	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
the	1

looked	1
of	1

several	1

it	1

the	1

jumped	1
down	1

held	1
out	1

to	1
assist	1
me	1
to	1
alight	1
again	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
notice	1
his	1
prodigious	1
strength	1
his	1
hand	1
actually	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1

that	1
could	1

my	1

placed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
beside	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
door	1
old	1
and	1
studded	1
with	1
large	1
iron	1

set	1
in	1
a	1
projecting	1
doorway	1
of	1
massive	1
stone	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
massively	1
carved	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
carving	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
worn	1
by	1
time	1
and	1
weather	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
the	1
driver	1
jumped	1
again	1
into	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
shook	1
the	1
reins	1
the	1
horses	1
started	1
forward	1
and	1

and	1
all	1
disappeared	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
openings	1
i	1
stood	1
in	1
silence	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
for	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1

the	1
time	1
i	1

seemed	1
endless	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears	1
crowding	1
upon	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
place	1
had	1
i	1
come	1
to	1
and	1
among	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
people	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
grim	1
adventure	1
was	1
it	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
embarked	1
was	1
this	1
a	1
customary	1
incident	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
solicitors	1
clerk	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
a	1
london	1
estate	1
to	1
a	1
foreigner	1
solicitors	1
clerk	1
mina	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
solicitor	1
for	1
just	1
before	1
leaving	1
london	1
i	1
got	1
word	1
that	1
my	1
examination	1
was	1
successful	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
a	1
fullblown	1
solicitor	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
rub	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
pinch	1
myself	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
awake	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
horrible	1
nightmare	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
expected	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
suddenly	1
awake	1
and	1
find	1
myself	1
at	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
dawn	1
struggling	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
windows	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
overwork	1
but	1
my	1
flesh	1
answered	1
the	1
pinching	1
test	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
i	1
was	1
indeed	1
awake	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
carpathians	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
patient	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
step	1
approaching	1
behind	1
the	1
great	1
door	1
and	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
chinks	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
a	1
coming	1
light	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
rattling	1
chains	1
and	1
the	1
clanking	1
of	1
massive	1
bolts	1
drawn	1
back	1
a	1
key	1
was	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
loud	1
grating	1
noise	1
of	1
long	1
disuse	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
door	1
swung	1
back	1
within	1
stood	1
a	1
tall	1
old	1
man	1
clean	1
shaven	1
save	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
white	1
moustache	1
and	1
clad	1
in	1
black	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
speck	1
of	1
colour	1
about	1
him	1
anywhere	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
an	1
antique	1
silver	1
lamp	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
name	1
burned	1
without	1
chimney	1
or	1
globe	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
throwing	1
long	1
quivering	1
shadows	1
as	1
it	1
flickered	1
in	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
motioned	1
me	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
courtly	1
gesture	1
saying	1
in	1
excellent	1
english	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
intonation	1
welcome	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
enter	1
freely	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
will	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
motion	1
of	1
stepping	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
but	1
stood	1
like	1
a	1
statue	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
gesture	1
of	1
welcome	1
had	1
fixed	1
him	1
into	1
stone	1
the	1
instant	1
however	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
stepped	1
over	1
the	1
threshold	1
he	1
moved	1
impulsively	1
forward	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
grasped	1
mine	1
with	1
a	1
strength	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
wince	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
lessened	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
cold	1
as	1
ice	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
than	1
a	1
living	1
man	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
welcome	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
come	1
freely	1
go	1
safely	1
and	1
leave	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
happiness	1
you	1
bring	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
handshake	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
akin	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
driver	1
whose	1
face	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
doubted	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
speaking	1
so	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
i	1
said	1
interrogatively	1
count	1
dracula	1
he	1
bowed	1
in	1
a	1
courtly	1
way	1
as	1
he	1
replied	1
i	1
am	1
dracula	1
and	1
i	1
bid	1
you	1
welcome	1
mr	1
harker	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
air	1
is	1
chill	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
need	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
rest	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
lamp	1
on	1
a	1
bracket	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
stepping	1
out	1
took	1
my	1
luggage	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
in	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
forestall	1
him	1
i	1
protested	1
but	1
he	1
insisted	1
nay	1
sir	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
guest	1
it	1
is	1
late	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
not	1
available	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
to	1
your	1
comfort	1
myself	1
he	1
insisted	1
on	1
carrying	1
my	1
traps	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
then	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
winding	1
stair	1
and	1
along	1
another	1
great	1
passage	1
on	1
whose	1
stone	1
floor	1
our	1
steps	1
rang	1
heavily	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
heavy	1
door	1
and	1
i	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
within	1
a	1
welllit	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
table	1
was	1
spread	1
for	1
supper	1
and	1
on	1
whose	1
mighty	1
hearth	1
a	1
great	1
fire	1
of	1
logs	1
freshly	1
replenished	1
flamed	1
and	1
flared	1
the	1
count	1
halted	1
putting	1
down	1
my	1
bags	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
room	1
opened	1
another	1
door	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
octagonal	1
room	1
lit	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
lamp	1
and	1
seemingly	1
without	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
passing	1
through	1
this	1
he	1
opened	1
another	1
door	1
and	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
welcome	1
sight	1
for	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
bedroom	1
well	1
lighted	1
and	1
warmed	1
with	1
another	1
log	1
fire	1
also	1
added	1
to	1
but	1
lately	1
for	1
the	1
top	1
logs	1
were	1
fresh	1
which	1
sent	1
a	1
hollow	1
roar	1
up	1
the	1
wide	1
chimney	1
the	1
count	1
himself	1
left	1
my	1
luggage	1
inside	1
and	1
withdrew	1
saying	1
before	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
you	1
will	1
need	1
after	1
your	1
journey	1
to	1
refresh	1
yourself	1
by	1
making	1
your	1
toilet	1
i	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
all	1
you	1
wish	1
when	1
you	1

into	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
your	1
supper	1
prepared	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
warmth	1
and	1
the	1
counts	1
courteous	1
welcome	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
dissipated	1
all	1
my	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears	1
having	1
then	1
reached	1
my	1
normal	1
state	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
half	1
famished	1
with	1
hunger	1
so	1
making	1
a	1
hasty	1
toilet	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
i	1
found	1
supper	1
already	1
laid	1
out	1
my	1
host	1
who	1
stood	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
fireplace	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
stonework	1
made	1
a	1
graceful	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
pray	1
you	1
be	1
seated	1
and	1
sup	1
how	1
you	1
please	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
trust	1
excuse	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
join	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
dined	1
already	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
sup	1
i	1
handed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
sealed	1
letter	1
which	1
mr	1
hawkins	1
had	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
opened	1
it	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
gravely	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
charming	1
smile	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
read	1
one	1
passage	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
least	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
pleasure	1
i	1
much	1
regret	1
that	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
gout	1
from	1
which	1
malady	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
constant	1

absolutely	1
any	1
travelling	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
i	1
can	1
send	1
a	1
sufficient	1
substitute	1
one	1
in	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
every	1
possible	1
confidence	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
talent	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
faithful	1
disposition	1
he	1
is	1
discreet	1
and	1
silent	1
and	1
has	1
grown	1
into	1
manhood	1
in	1
my	1
service	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
attend	1
on	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
your	1
instructions	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
the	1
count	1
himself	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
i	1
fell	1
to	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
an	1
excellent	1
roast	1
chicken	1
this	1
with	1
some	1
cheese	1
and	1
a	1
salad	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
old	1
tokay	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
two	1
glasses	1
was	1
my	1
supper	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
eating	1
it	1
the	1
count	1
asked	1
me	1
many	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
journey	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
degrees	1
all	1
i	1
had	1
experienced	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
my	1
supper	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
hosts	1
desire	1
had	1
drawn	1
up	1
a	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
smoke	1
a	1
cigar	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
excusing	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
smoke	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
observing	1
him	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
marked	1
physiognomy	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
aquiline	1
with	1
high	1
bridge	1
of	1
the	1
thin	1
nose	1
and	1
peculiarly	1
arched	1
nostrils	1
with	1
lofty	1
domed	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair	1
growing	1
scantily	1
round	1
the	1
temples	1
but	1
profusely	1
elsewhere	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
very	1
massive	1
almost	1
meeting	1
over	1
the	1
nose	1
and	1
with	1
bushy	1
hair	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
curl	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
profusion	1
the	1
mouth	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
heavy	1
moustache	1
was	1
fixed	1
and	1
rather	1
cruellooking	1
with	1
peculiarly	1
sharp	1
white	1
teeth	1
these	1
protruded	1
over	1
the	1
lips	1
whose	1
remarkable	1
ruddiness	1
showed	1
astonishing	1
vitality	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
years	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
pale	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
extremely	1
pointed	1
the	1
chin	1
was	1
broad	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
the	1
cheeks	1
firm	1
though	1
thin	1
the	1
general	1
effect	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
extraordinary	1
pallor	1
hitherto	1
i	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
they	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
firelight	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
seemed	1
rather	1
white	1
and	1
fine	1
but	1
seeing	1
them	1
now	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
notice	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
rather	1
coarse	1
broad	1
with	1
squat	1
fingers	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
were	1
hairs	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
palm	1
the	1
nails	1
were	1
long	1
and	1
fine	1
and	1
cut	1
to	1
a	1
sharp	1
point	1
as	1
the	1
count	1
learned	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
touched	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
a	1
shudder	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
his	1
breath	1
was	1
rank	1
but	1
a	1
horrible	1
feeling	1
of	1
nausea	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
which	1
do	1
what	1
i	1
would	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
the	1
count	1
evidently	1
noticing	1
it	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
grim	1
sort	1
of	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
done	1
his	1
protuberant	1
teeth	1
sat	1
himself	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace	1
we	1
were	1
both	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
dim	1
streak	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
dawn	1
there	1
seemed	1
a	1
strange	1
stillness	1
over	1
everything	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
listened	1
i	1
heard	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
down	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
many	1
wolves	1
the	1
counts	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
what	1
music	1
they	1
make	1
seeing	1
i	1
suppose	1
some	1
expression	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
added	1
ah	1
sir	1
you	1
dwellers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
cannot	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
hunter	1
then	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
said	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
tired	1
your	1
bedroom	1
is	1
all	1
ready	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
shall	1
sleep	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
till	1
the	1
afternoon	1
so	1
sleep	1
well	1
and	1
dream	1
well	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1
bow	1
he	1
opened	1
for	1
me	1
himself	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
octagonal	1
room	1
and	1
i	1
entered	1
my	1
bedroom	1
i	1
am	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
wonders	1
i	1
doubt	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
think	1
strange	1
things	1
which	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
confess	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
soul	1
god	1
keep	1
me	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
those	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
7	1
may	1
it	1
is	1
again	1
early	1
morning	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
rested	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
last	1
twentyfour	1
hours	1
i	1
slept	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
awoke	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
accord	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
dressed	1
myself	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
we	1
had	1
supped	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
cold	1
breakfast	1
laid	1
out	1
with	1
coffee	1
kept	1
hot	1
by	1
the	1
pot	1
being	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
hearth	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
card	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
do	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
me	1
d	1
i	1
set	1
to	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
hearty	1
meal	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
done	1
i	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
bell	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
let	1
the	1
servants	1
know	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
one	1
there	1
are	1
certainly	1
odd	1
deficiencies	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
considering	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
evidences	1
of	1
wealth	1
which	1
are	1
round	1
me	1
the	1
table	1
service	1
is	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
so	1
beautifully	1
wrought	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
immense	1
value	1
the	1
curtains	1
and	1
upholstery	1
of	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
sofas	1
and	1
the	1
hangings	1
of	1
my	1
bed	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
costliest	1
and	1
most	1
beautiful	1
fabrics	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
fabulous	1
value	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
centuries	1
old	1
though	1
in	1
excellent	1
order	1
i	1
saw	1
something	1
like	1
them	1
in	1
hampton	1
court	1
but	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
worn	1
and	1
frayed	1
and	1
motheaten	1
but	1
still	1
in	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
there	1
a	1
mirror	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
toilet	1
glass	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
little	1
shaving	1
glass	1
from	1
my	1
bag	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
either	1
shave	1
or	1
brush	1
my	1
hair	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
a	1
servant	1
anywhere	1
or	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
near	1
the	1
castle	1
except	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
wolves	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
my	1
meal	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
breakfast	1
or	1
dinner	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
between	1
five	1
and	1
six	1
oclock	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
it	1
i	1
looked	1
about	1
for	1
something	1
to	1
read	1
for	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
castle	1
until	1
i	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
counts	1
permission	1
there	1
was	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
book	1
newspaper	1
or	1
even	1
writing	1
materials	1
so	1
i	1
opened	1
another	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
library	1
the	1
door	1
opposite	1
mine	1
i	1
tried	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
locked	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
i	1
found	1
to	1
my	1
great	1
delight	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
english	1
books	1
whole	1
shelves	1
full	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
bound	1
volumes	1
of	1
magazines	1
and	1
newspapers	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
english	1
magazines	1
and	1
newspapers	1
though	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
very	1
recent	1
date	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
varied	1
kind	1
history	1
geography	1
politics	1
political	1
economy	1
botany	1
geology	1
law	1
all	1
relating	1
to	1
england	1
and	1
english	1
life	1
and	1
customs	1
and	1
manners	1
there	1
were	1
even	1
such	1
books	1
of	1
reference	1
as	1
the	1
london	1
directory	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
blue	1
books	1
whitakers	1
almanac	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
lists	1
and	1
it	1
somehow	1
gladdened	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
the	1

to	1
be	1
in	1

that	1

for	1
your	1

but	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
road	1

would	1

true	1

yet	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
speak	1
them	1
indeed	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
speak	1
excellently	1
not	1
so	1
he	1
answered	1
well	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
did	1
i	1
move	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
your	1
london	1
none	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
noble	1
i	1
am	1
boyar	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
know	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
master	1
but	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
men	1
know	1
him	1
not	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
not	1
is	1
to	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
content	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
stops	1
if	1
he	1
see	1
me	1
or	1
pause	1
in	1
his	1
speaking	1
if	1
he	1
hear	1
my	1
words	1
ha	1
ha	1
a	1
stranger	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
master	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
master	1
still	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
none	1
other	1
should	1
be	1
master	1
of	1
me	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
alone	1
as	1
agent	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
peter	1
hawkins	1
of	1
exeter	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
my	1
new	1
estate	1
in	1
london	1
you	1
shall	1
i	1
trust	1
rest	1
here	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
while	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
our	1
talking	1
i	1
may	1
learn	1
the	1
english	1
intonation	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
that	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
make	1
error	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
smallest	1
in	1
my	1
speaking	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
so	1
long	1
today	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
know	1
forgive	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
important	1
affairs	1
in	1
hand	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
said	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
about	1
being	1
willing	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
i	1
might	1
come	1
into	1
that	1
room	1
when	1
i	1
chose	1
he	1
answered	1
yes	1
certainly	1
and	1
added	1
you	1
may	1
go	1
anywhere	1
you	1
wish	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
except	1
where	1
the	1
doors	1
are	1
locked	1
where	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
did	1
you	1
see	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
know	1
with	1
my	1
knowledge	1
you	1
would	1
perhaps	1
better	1
understand	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
transylvania	1
and	1
transylvania	1
is	1
not	1
england	1
our	1
ways	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
many	1
strange	1
things	1
nay	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
experiences	1
already	1
you	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
what	1
strange	1
things	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
this	1
led	1
to	1
much	1
conversation	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
talkings	1
sake	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
many	1
questions	1
regarding	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
already	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
come	1
within	1
my	1
notice	1
sometimes	1
he	1
sheered	1
off	1
the	1
subject	1
or	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
by	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
but	1
generally	1
he	1
answered	1
all	1
i	1
asked	1
most	1
frankly	1
then	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
got	1
somewhat	1
bolder	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
why	1
the	1
coachman	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
places	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
blue	1
flames	1
he	1
then	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
commonly	1
believed	1
that	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
last	1
night	1
in	1
fact	1
when	1
all	1
evil	1
spirits	1
are	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
unchecked	1
sway	1
a	1
blue	1
flame	1
is	1
seen	1
over	1
any	1
place	1
where	1
treasure	1
has	1
been	1
concealed	1
that	1
treasure	1
has	1
been	1
hidden	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
region	1
through	1
which	1
you	1
came	1
last	1
night	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
but	1
little	1
doubt	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
ground	1
fought	1
over	1
for	1
centuries	1
by	1
the	1
wallachian	1
the	1
saxon	1
and	1
the	1
turk	1
why	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
foot	1
of	1
soil	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
region	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
enriched	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
men	1
patriots	1
or	1
invaders	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
there	1
were	1
stirring	1
times	1
when	1
the	1
austrian	1
and	1
the	1
hungarian	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
hordes	1
and	1
the	1
patriots	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
the	1
aged	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
too	1
and	1
waited	1
their	1
coming	1
on	1
the	1
rocks	1
above	1
the	1
passes	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
sweep	1
destruction	1
on	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
artificial	1
avalanches	1
when	1
the	1
invader	1
was	1
triumphant	1
he	1
found	1
but	1
little	1
for	1
whatever	1
there	1
was	1
had	1
been	1
sheltered	1
in	1
the	1
friendly	1
soil	1
but	1
how	1
said	1
i	1
can	1
it	1
have	1
remained	1
so	1
long	1
undiscovered	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sure	1
index	1
to	1
it	1
if	1
men	1
will	1
but	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
look	1
the	1
count	1
smiled	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
lips	1
ran	1
back	1
over	1
his	1
gums	1
the	1
long	1
sharp	1
canine	1
teeth	1
showed	1
out	1
strangely	1
he	1
answered	1
because	1
your	1
peasant	1
is	1
at	1
heart	1
a	1
coward	1
and	1
a	1
fool	1
those	1
names	1
only	1
appear	1
on	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
will	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
help	1
it	1
stir	1
without	1
his	1
doors	1
and	1
dear	1
sir	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
why	1
even	1
the	1
peasant	1
that	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
who	1
marked	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
flame	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
daylight	1
even	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
work	1
even	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
i	1
dare	1
be	1
sworn	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
these	1
places	1
again	1
there	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
know	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
dead	1
where	1
even	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
them	1
then	1
we	1
drifted	1
into	1
other	1
matters	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
london	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
procured	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
my	1
remissness	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
papers	1
from	1
my	1
bag	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
placing	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
rattling	1
of	1
china	1
and	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
passed	1
through	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
table	1
had	1
been	1
cleared	1
and	1
the	1
lamp	1
lit	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
deep	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
the	1
lamps	1
were	1
also	1
lit	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
or	1
library	1
and	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
count	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
reading	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
an	1
english	1
bradshaws	1
guide	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
cleared	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
plans	1
and	1
deeds	1
and	1
figures	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
he	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
everything	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
a	1
myriad	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
its	1
surroundings	1
he	1
clearly	1
had	1
studied	1
beforehand	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
for	1
he	1
evidently	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
knew	1
very	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
did	1
when	1
i	1
remarked	1
this	1
he	1
answered	1
well	1
but	1
my	1
friend	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
needful	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
when	1
i	1
go	1
there	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
alone	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
harker	1
jonathan	1
nay	1
pardon	1
me	1
i	1
fall	1
into	1
my	1
countrys	1
habit	1
of	1
putting	1
your	1
patronymic	1
first	1
my	1
friend	1
jonathan	1
harker	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
by	1
my	1
side	1
to	1
correct	1
and	1
aid	1
me	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
exeter	1
miles	1
away	1
probably	1
working	1
at	1
papers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
with	1
my	1
other	1
friend	1
peter	1
hawkins	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
thoroughly	1
into	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
at	1
purfleet	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
got	1
his	1
signature	1
to	1
the	1
necessary	1
papers	1
and	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
with	1

mr	1
hawkins	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
how	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
across	1
so	1
suitable	1
a	1
place	1
i	1
read	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
notes	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
made	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
which	1
i	1
inscribe	1
here	1
at	1
purfleet	1
on	1
a	1
byroad	1
i	1
came	1
across	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
required	1
and	1
where	1
was	1
displayed	1
a	1
dilapidated	1
notice	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
for	1
sale	1
it	1
is	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
high	1
wall	1
of	1
ancient	1
structure	1
built	1
of	1
heavy	1
stones	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
repaired	1
for	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
the	1
closed	1
gates	1
are	1
of	1
heavy	1
old	1
oak	1
and	1
iron	1
all	1
eaten	1
with	1
rust	1
the	1
estate	1
is	1
called	1
carfax	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
corruption	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
quatre	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
foursided	1
agreeing	1
with	1
the	1
cardinal	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
compass	1
it	1
contains	1
in	1
all	1
some	1
twenty	1
acres	1
quite	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
solid	1
stone	1
wall	1
above	1
mentioned	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
trees	1
on	1
it	1
which	1
make	1
it	1
in	1
places	1
gloomy	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
deep	1
darklooking	1
pond	1
or	1
small	1
lake	1
evidently	1
fed	1
by	1
some	1
springs	1
as	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
flows	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
fairsized	1
stream	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
very	1
large	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
periods	1
back	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
mediaeval	1
times	1
for	1
one	1
part	1
is	1
of	1
stone	1
immensely	1
thick	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
windows	1
high	1
up	1
and	1
heavily	1
barred	1
with	1
iron	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
keep	1
and	1
is	1
close	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
chapel	1
or	1
church	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
leading	1
to	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
taken	1
with	1
my	1
kodak	1
views	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
various	1
points	1
the	1
house	1
has	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
straggling	1
way	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
only	1
guess	1
at	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
ground	1
it	1
covers	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
great	1
there	1
are	1
but	1
few	1
houses	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
one	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
house	1
only	1
recently	1
added	1
to	1
and	1
formed	1
into	1
a	1
private	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
however	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
grounds	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
big	1
i	1
myself	1
am	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
house	1
would	1
kill	1
me	1
a	1
house	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
habitable	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
how	1
few	1
days	1
go	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
a	1
century	1
i	1
rejoice	1
also	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
chapel	1
of	1
old	1
times	1
we	1
transylvanian	1
nobles	1
love	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
our	1
bones	1
may	1
lie	1
amongst	1
the	1
common	1
dead	1
i	1
seek	1
not	1
gaiety	1
nor	1
mirth	1
not	1
the	1
bright	1
voluptuousness	1
of	1
much	1
sunshine	1
and	1
sparkling	1
waters	1
which	1
please	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
gay	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
young	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
through	1
weary	1
years	1
of	1
mourning	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
is	1
not	1
attuned	1
to	1
mirth	1
moreover	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
my	1
castle	1
are	1
broken	1
the	1
shadows	1
are	1
many	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
breathes	1
cold	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
battlements	1
and	1
casements	1
i	1
love	1
the	1
shade	1
and	1
the	1
shadow	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
alone	1
with	1
my	1
thoughts	1
when	1
i	1
may	1
somehow	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
his	1
look	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
accord	1
or	1
else	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
cast	1
of	1
face	1
made	1
his	1
smile	1
look	1
malignant	1
and	1
saturnine	1
presently	1
with	1
an	1
excuse	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
put	1
all	1
my	1
papers	1
together	1
he	1
was	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
away	1
and	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
around	1
me	1
one	1
was	1
an	1
atlas	1
which	1
i	1
found	1
opened	1
naturally	1
at	1
england	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
map	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
used	1
on	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
i	1
found	1
in	1
certain	1
places	1
little	1
rings	1
marked	1
and	1
on	1
examining	1
these	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
one	1
was	1
near	1
london	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
manifestly	1
where	1
his	1
new	1
estate	1
was	1
situated	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
were	1
exeter	1
and	1
whitby	1
on	1
the	1
yorkshire	1
coast	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
returned	1
aha	1
he	1
said	1
still	1
at	1
your	1
books	1
good	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
work	1
always	1
come	1
i	1
am	1
informed	1
that	1
your	1
supper	1
is	1
ready	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
where	1
i	1
found	1
an	1
excellent	1
supper	1
ready	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
count	1
again	1
excused	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
dined	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
being	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
but	1
he	1
sat	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
night	1
and	1
chatted	1
whilst	1
i	1
ate	1
after	1
supper	1
i	1
smoked	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
stayed	1
with	1
me	1
chatting	1
and	1
asking	1
questions	1
on	1
every	1
conceivable	1
subject	1
hour	1
after	1
hour	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
very	1
late	1
indeed	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
under	1
obligation	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
hosts	1
wishes	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
sleepy	1
as	1
the	1
long	1
sleep	1
yesterday	1
had	1
fortified	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
experiencing	1
that	1
chill	1
which	1
comes	1
over	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
tide	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
near	1
death	1
die	1
generally	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
to	1
the	1
dawn	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
tide	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
when	1
tired	1
and	1
tied	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
his	1
post	1
experienced	1
this	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
can	1
well	1
believe	1
it	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
crow	1
of	1
a	1
cock	1
coming	1
up	1
with	1
preternatural	1
shrillness	1
through	1
the	1
clear	1
morning	1
air	1
count	1
dracula	1
jumping	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
said	1
why	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
morning	1
again	1
how	1
remiss	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
stay	1
up	1
so	1
long	1
you	1
must	1
make	1
your	1
conversation	1
regarding	1
my	1
dear	1
new	1
country	1
of	1
england	1
less	1
interesting	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
not	1
forget	1
how	1
time	1
flies	1
by	1
us	1
and	1
with	1
courtly	1
bow	1
he	1
quickly	1
left	1
me	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
curtains	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
notice	1
my	1
window	1
opened	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
the	1
warm	1
grey	1
of	1
quickening	1
sky	1
so	1
i	1
pulled	1
the	1
curtains	1
again	1
and	1
have	1
written	1
of	1
this	1
day	1
8	1
may	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
as	1
i	1
wrote	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
getting	1
too	1
diffuse	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
that	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
detail	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
so	1
strange	1
about	1
this	1
place	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
feel	1
uneasy	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
were	1
safe	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
or	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
come	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
this	1
strange	1
nightexistence	1
is	1
telling	1
on	1
me	1
but	1
would	1
that	1
that	1
were	1
all	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
i	1
could	1
bear	1
it	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
i	1
have	1
only	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
and	1
he	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
am	1
myself	1
the	1
only	1
living	1
soul	1
within	1
the	1
place	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
prosaic	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
facts	1
can	1
be	1
it	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
bear	1
up	1
and	1
imagination	1
must	1
not	1
run	1
riot	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
i	1
am	1
lost	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
at	1
once	1
how	1
i	1
stand	1
or	1
seem	1
to	1
i	1
only	1
slept	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
any	1
more	1
got	1
up	1
i	1
had	1
hung	1
my	1
shaving	1
glass	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
shave	1
suddenly	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
counts	1
voice	1
saying	1
to	1
me	1
goodmorning	1
i	1
started	1
for	1
it	1
amazed	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
covered	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
behind	1
me	1
in	1
starting	1
i	1
had	1
cut	1
myself	1
slightly	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
having	1
answered	1
the	1
counts	1
salutation	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
glass	1
again	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
this	1
time	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
error	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
over	1
my	1
shoulder	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reflection	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
behind	1
me	1
was	1
displayed	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
except	1
myself	1
this	1
was	1
startling	1
and	1
coming	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
strange	1
things	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
increase	1
that	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
which	1
i	1
always	1
have	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
near	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
cut	1
had	1
bled	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
trickling	1
over	1
my	1
chin	1
i	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
razor	1
turning	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
half	1
round	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
some	1
sticking	1
plaster	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
saw	1
my	1
face	1
his	1
eyes	1
blazed	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
demoniac	1
fury	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
made	1
a	1
grab	1
at	1
my	1
throat	1
i	1
drew	1
away	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
touched	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
beads	1
which	1
held	1
the	1
crucifix	1
it	1
made	1
an	1
instant	1
change	1
in	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
fury	1
passed	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ever	1
there	1
take	1
care	1
he	1
said	1
take	1
care	1
how	1
you	1
cut	1
yourself	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
dangerous	1
than	1
you	1
think	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
then	1
seizing	1
the	1
shaving	1
glass	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
wretched	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
done	1
the	1
mischief	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
foul	1
bauble	1
of	1
mans	1
vanity	1
away	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
heavy	1
window	1
with	1
one	1
wrench	1
of	1
his	1
terrible	1
hand	1
he	1
flung	1
out	1
the	1
glass	1
which	1
was	1
shattered	1
into	1
a	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
on	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
courtyard	1
far	1
below	1
then	1
he	1
withdrew	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
annoying	1
for	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
shave	1
unless	1
in	1
my	1
watchcase	1
or	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
shavingpot	1
which	1
is	1
fortunately	1
of	1
metal	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
diningroom	1
breakfast	1
was	1
prepared	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
count	1
anywhere	1
so	1
i	1
breakfasted	1
alone	1
it	1
is	1
strange	1
that	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
eat	1
or	1
drink	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
peculiar	1
man	1
after	1
breakfast	1
i	1
did	1
a	1
little	1
exploring	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
room	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
the	1
view	1
was	1
magnificent	1
and	1
from	1
where	1
i	1
stood	1
there	1
was	1
every	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
it	1
the	1
castle	1
is	1
on	1
the	1

edge	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
precipice	1
a	1
stone	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1

without	1
touching	1
anything	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1

of	1

with	1
occasionally	1

there	1

i	1
am	1
not	1
in	1

to	1
describe	1
beauty	1
for	1
when	1
i	1

the	1

journal	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
wild	1
feeling	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
i	1
rushed	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
trying	1
every	1
door	1
and	1
peering	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
window	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
my	1
helplessness	1
overpowered	1
all	1
other	1
feelings	1
when	1
i	1
look	1
back	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
mad	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
i	1
behaved	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
rat	1
does	1
in	1
a	1
trap	1
when	1
however	1
the	1
conviction	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
helpless	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
quietly	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
anything	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
i	1
am	1
thinking	1
still	1
and	1
as	1
yet	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
no	1
definite	1
conclusion	1
of	1
one	1
thing	1
only	1
am	1
i	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
making	1
my	1
ideas	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
knows	1
well	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
imprisoned	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
it	1
himself	1
and	1
has	1
doubtless	1
his	1
own	1
motives	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
only	1
deceive	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
trusted	1
him	1
fully	1
with	1
the	1
facts	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
my	1
only	1
plan	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
knowledge	1
and	1
my	1
fears	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
open	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
know	1
either	1
being	1
deceived	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
fears	1
or	1
else	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
desperate	1
straits	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
be	1
so	1
i	1
need	1
and	1
shall	1
need	1
all	1
my	1
brains	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
i	1
had	1
hardly	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
great	1
door	1
below	1
shut	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
returned	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
library	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
cautiously	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
making	1
the	1
bed	1
this	1
was	1
odd	1
but	1
only	1
confirmed	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
all	1
along	1
though	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
later	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
chink	1
of	1
the	1
hinges	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
laying	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
diningroom	1
i	1
was	1
assured	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
himself	1
all	1
these	1
menial	1
offices	1
surely	1
it	1
is	1
proof	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
this	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
fright	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
count	1
himself	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
driver	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
that	1
brought	1
me	1
here	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
thought	1
for	1
if	1
so	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
control	1
the	1
wolves	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
by	1
only	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
silence	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
bistritz	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
coach	1
had	1
some	1
terrible	1
fear	1
for	1
me	1
what	1
meant	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
crucifix	1
of	1
the	1
garlic	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
rose	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
ash	1
bless	1
that	1
good	1
good	1
woman	1
who	1
hung	1
the	1
crucifix	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
and	1
a	1
strength	1
to	1
me	1
whenever	1
i	1
touch	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
odd	1
that	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
regard	1
with	1
disfavour	1
and	1
as	1
idolatrous	1
should	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
loneliness	1
and	1
trouble	1
be	1
of	1
help	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
itself	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
medium	1
a	1
tangible	1
help	1
in	1
conveying	1
memories	1
of	1
sympathy	1
and	1
comfort	1
some	1
time	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
i	1
must	1
examine	1
this	1
matter	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
i	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
about	1
count	1
dracula	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
tonight	1
he	1
may	1
talk	1
of	1
himself	1
if	1
i	1
turn	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
careful	1
however	1
not	1
to	1
awake	1
his	1
suspicion	1
midnight	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
count	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
on	1
transylvania	1
history	1
and	1
he	1
warmed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
wonderfully	1
in	1
his	1
speaking	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
people	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
battles	1
he	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
afterwards	1
explained	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
to	1
a	1
boyar	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
name	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
pride	1
that	1
their	1
glory	1
is	1
his	1
glory	1
that	1
their	1
fate	1
is	1
his	1
fate	1
whenever	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
he	1
always	1
said	1
we	1
and	1
spoke	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
plural	1
like	1
a	1
king	1
speaking	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
for	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
fascinating	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
grew	1
excited	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
pulling	1
his	1
great	1
white	1
moustache	1
and	1
grasping	1
anything	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
crush	1
it	1
by	1
main	1
strength	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
put	1
down	1
as	1
nearly	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
for	1
it	1
tells	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
race	1
we	1
szekelys	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
for	1
in	1
our	1
veins	1
flows	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
many	1
brave	1
races	1
who	1
fought	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
fights	1
for	1
lordship	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
whirlpool	1
of	1
european	1
races	1
the	1
ugric	1
tribe	1
bore	1
down	1
from	1
iceland	1
the	1
fighting	1
spirit	1
which	1
thor	1
and	1
wodin	1
gave	1
them	1
which	1
their	1
berserkers	1
displayed	1
to	1
such	1
fell	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
seaboards	1
of	1
europe	1
ay	1
and	1
of	1

too	1
till	1
the	1
peoples	1
thought	1
that	1

had	1
come	1
here	1
too	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
huns	1
whose	1
warlike	1
fury	1
had	1
swept	1
the	1
earth	1
like	1
a	1

the	1

the	1

of	1
those	1
old	1

what	1

what	1

is	1
in	1
these	1

he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1

it	1
a	1
wonder	1
that	1
we	1

were	1

the	1
magyar	1
the	1
lombard	1
the	1
avar	1
the	1
bulgar	1
or	1
the	1
turk	1
poured	1
his	1
thousands	1
on	1
our	1
frontiers	1
we	1
drove	1
them	1
back	1
is	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
when	1
arpad	1
and	1
his	1
legions	1
swept	1
through	1
the	1
hungarian	1
fatherland	1
he	1
found	1
us	1
here	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
frontier	1
that	1
the	1
honfoglalas	1
was	1
completed	1
there	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
hungarian	1
flood	1
swept	1
eastward	1
the	1
szekelys	1
were	1
claimed	1
as	1
kindred	1
by	1
the	1
victorious	1
magyars	1
and	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
centuries	1
was	1
trusted	1
the	1
guarding	1
of	1
the	1
frontier	1
of	1
turkeyland	1
ay	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
endless	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
frontier	1
guard	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
turks	1
say	1
water	1
sleeps	1
and	1
enemy	1
is	1
sleepless	1
who	1
more	1
gladly	1
than	1
we	1
throughout	1
the	1
four	1
nations	1
received	1
the	1
bloody	1
sword	1
or	1
at	1
its	1
warlike	1
call	1
flocked	1
quicker	1
to	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
when	1
was	1
redeemed	1
that	1
great	1
shame	1
of	1
my	1
nation	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
cassova	1
when	1
the	1
flags	1
of	1
the	1
wallach	1
and	1
the	1
magyar	1
went	1
down	1
beneath	1
the	1
crescent	1
who	1
was	1
it	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
race	1
who	1
as	1
voivode	1
crossed	1
the	1
danube	1
and	1
beat	1
the	1
turk	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ground	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
dracula	1
indeed	1
woe	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
unworthy	1
brother	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
sold	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
turk	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
slavery	1
on	1
them	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
this	1
dracula	1
indeed	1
who	1
inspired	1
that	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
race	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
later	1
age	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
brought	1
his	1
forces	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
into	1
turkeyland	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
beaten	1
back	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
come	1
alone	1
from	1
the	1
bloody	1
field	1
where	1
his	1
troops	1
were	1
being	1
slaughtered	1
since	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
ultimately	1
triumph	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
himself	1
bah	1
what	1
good	1
are	1
peasants	1
without	1
a	1
leader	1
where	1
ends	1
the	1
war	1
without	1
a	1
brain	1
and	1
heart	1
to	1
conduct	1
it	1
again	1
when	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
mohacs	1
we	1
threw	1
off	1
the	1
hungarian	1
yoke	1
we	1
of	1
the	1
dracula	1
blood	1
were	1
amongst	1
their	1
leaders	1
for	1
our	1
spirit	1
would	1
not	1
brook	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
free	1
ah	1
young	1
sir	1
the	1
szekelys	1
and	1
the	1
dracula	1
as	1
their	1
hearts	1
blood	1
their	1
brains	1
and	1
their	1
swords	1
can	1
boast	1
a	1
record	1
that	1
mushroom	1
growths	1
like	1
the	1
hapsburgs	1
and	1
the	1
romanoffs	1
can	1
never	1
reach	1
the	1
warlike	1
days	1
are	1
over	1
blood	1
is	1
too	1
precious	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
dishonourable	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
races	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
tale	1
that	1
is	1
told	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
close	1
on	1
morning	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
mem	1
this	1
diary	1
seems	1
horribly	1
like	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
arabian	1
nights	1
for	1
everything	1
has	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
at	1
cockcrow	1
or	1
like	1
the	1
ghost	1
of	1
hamlets	1
father	1
12	1
may	1
let	1
me	1
begin	1
with	1
facts	1
bare	1
meagre	1
facts	1
verified	1
by	1
books	1
and	1
figures	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
confuse	1
them	1
with	1
experiences	1
which	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
observation	1
or	1
my	1
memory	1
of	1
them	1
last	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
asking	1
me	1
questions	1
on	1
legal	1
matters	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
certain	1
kinds	1
of	1
business	1
i	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
day	1
wearily	1
over	1
books	1
and	1
simply	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
mind	1
occupied	1
went	1
over	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
matters	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
examined	1
in	1
at	1
lincolns	1
inn	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
method	1
in	1
the	1
counts	1
inquiries	1
so	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
down	1
in	1
sequence	1
the	1
knowledge	1
may	1
somehow	1
or	1
some	1
time	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
first	1
he	1
asked	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
england	1
might	1
have	1
two	1
solicitors	1
or	1
more	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
dozen	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wise	1
to	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
solicitor	1
engaged	1
in	1
one	1
transaction	1
as	1
only	1
one	1
could	1
act	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
change	1
would	1
be	1
certain	1
to	1
militate	1
against	1
his	1
interest	1
he	1
seemed	1
thoroughly	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
ask	1
if	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
practical	1
difficulty	1
in	1
having	1
one	1
man	1
to	1
attend	1
say	1
to	1
banking	1
and	1
another	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
shipping	1
in	1
case	1
local	1
help	1
were	1
needed	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
home	1
of	1
the	1
banking	1
solicitor	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
more	1
fully	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
mislead	1
him	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
shall	1
illustrate	1
your	1
friend	1
and	1
mine	1
mr	1
peter	1
hawkins	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
your	1
beautiful	1
cathedral	1
at	1
exeter	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
london	1
buys	1
for	1
me	1
through	1
your	1
good	1
self	1
my	1
place	1
at	1
london	1
good	1
now	1
here	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
frankly	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
sought	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
one	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
london	1
instead	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
resident	1
there	1
that	1
my	1
motive	1
was	1
that	1
no	1
local	1
interest	1
might	1
be	1
served	1
save	1
my	1
wish	1
only	1
and	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
london	1
resident	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
some	1
purpose	1
of	1
himself	1
or	1
friend	1
to	1
serve	1
i	1
went	1
thus	1
afield	1
to	1
seek	1
my	1
agent	1
whose	1
labours	1
should	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
my	1
interest	1
now	1
suppose	1
i	1
who	1
have	1
much	1
of	1
affairs	1
wish	1
to	1
ship	1
goods	1
say	1
to	1
newcastle	1
or	1
durham	1
or	1
harwich	1
or	1
dover	1
might	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
with	1
more	1
ease	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
consigning	1
to	1
one	1
in	1
these	1
ports	1
i	1
answered	1
that	1
certainly	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
easy	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
solicitors	1
had	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
agency	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
so	1
that	1
local	1
work	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
locally	1
on	1
instruction	1
from	1
any	1
solicitor	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
client	1
simply	1
placing	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
could	1
have	1
his	1
wishes	1
carried	1
out	1
by	1
him	1
without	1
further	1
trouble	1
but	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
direct	1
myself	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
replied	1
and	1
such	1
is	1
often	1
done	1
by	1
men	1
of	1
business	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
affairs	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
person	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
consignments	1
and	1
the	1
forms	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
through	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
difficulties	1
which	1
might	1
arise	1
but	1
by	1
fore	1
thought	1
could	1
be	1
guarded	1
against	1
i	1
explained	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
and	1
he	1
certainly	1
left	1
me	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
wonderful	1
solicitor	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
or	1
foresee	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
never	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
evidently	1
do	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
business	1
his	1
knowledge	1
and	1
acumen	1
were	1
wonderful	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
on	1
these	1
points	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
verified	1
all	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
by	1
the	1
books	1
available	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
have	1
you	1
written	1
since	1
your	1
first	1
letter	1
to	1
our	1
friend	1
mr	1
peter	1
hawkins	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
some	1
bitterness	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
i	1
answered	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
that	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
any	1
opportunity	1
of	1
sending	1
letters	1
to	1
anybody	1
then	1
write	1
now	1
my	1
young	1
friend	1
he	1
said	1
laying	1
a	1
heavy	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder	1
write	1
to	1
our	1
friend	1
and	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
and	1
say	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
stay	1
with	1
me	1
until	1
a	1
month	1
from	1
now	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
stay	1
so	1
long	1
i	1
asked	1
for	1
my	1
heart	1
grew	1
cold	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
i	1
desire	1
it	1
much	1
nay	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
no	1
refusal	1
when	1
your	1
master	1
employer	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
engaged	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
should	1
come	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
that	1
my	1
needs	1
only	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
consulted	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
stinted	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
do	1
but	1
bow	1
acceptance	1
it	1
was	1
mr	1
hawkinss	1
interest	1
not	1
mine	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
not	1
myself	1
and	1
besides	1
which	1
count	1
dracula	1
was	1
speaking	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
bearing	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
wished	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
choice	1
the	1
count	1
saw	1
his	1
victory	1
in	1
my	1
bow	1
and	1
his	1
mastery	1
in	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
my	1
face	1
for	1
he	1
began	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
smooth	1
resistless	1
way	1
i	1
pray	1
you	1
my	1
good	1
young	1
friend	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
discourse	1
of	1
things	1
other	1
than	1
business	1
in	1
your	1
letters	1
it	1
will	1
doubtless	1
please	1
your	1
friends	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
getting	1
home	1
to	1
them	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
three	1
sheets	1
of	1
notepaper	1
and	1
three	1
envelopes	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
thinnest	1
foreign	1
post	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
then	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
noticing	1
his	1
quiet	1
smile	1
with	1
the	1
sharp	1
canine	1
teeth	1
lying	1
over	1
the	1
red	1
underlip	1
i	1
understood	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
careful	1
what	1
i	1
wrote	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
so	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
write	1
only	1
formal	1
notes	1
now	1
but	1
to	1
write	1
fully	1
to	1
mr	1
hawkins	1
in	1
secret	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
mina	1
for	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
write	1
in	1
shorthand	1
which	1
would	1
puzzle	1
the	1
count	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
see	1
it	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
written	1
my	1
two	1
letters	1
i	1
sat	1
quiet	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
whilst	1
the	1
count	1
wrote	1
several	1
notes	1
referring	1
as	1
he	1
wrote	1
them	1
to	1
some	1
books	1
on	1
his	1
table	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
my	1
two	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
put	1
by	1
his	1
writing	1
materials	1
after	1
which	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
door	1
had	1
closed	1
behind	1
him	1
i	1
leaned	1
over	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
letters	1
which	1
were	1
face	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
i	1
felt	1
no	1
compunction	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
for	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
protect	1
myself	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
i	1
could	1
one	1
of	1

the	1

i	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
doorhandle	1
move	1
i	1
sank	1
back	1
in	1
my	1
seat	1
having	1
just	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
replace	1
the	1
letters	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
to	1
resume	1
my	1
book	1
before	1
the	1
count	1
holding	1
still	1
another	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
letters	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
stamped	1
them	1
carefully	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
i	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
private	1
this	1
evening	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
hope	1
find	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
you	1
wish	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moments	1
pause	1
said	1
let	1
me	1
advise	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
friend	1
nay	1
let	1
me	1
warn	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
seriousness	1
that	1
should	1
you	1
leave	1
these	1
rooms	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
it	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
has	1
many	1
memories	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
bad	1
dreams	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
sleep	1
unwisely	1
be	1
warned	1
should	1
sleep	1
now	1
or	1
ever	1
overcome	1
you	1
or	1
be	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
then	1
haste	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
chamber	1
or	1
to	1
these	1
rooms	1
for	1
your	1
rest	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
safe	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
not	1
careful	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
then	1
he	1
finished	1
his	1
speech	1
in	1
a	1
gruesome	1
way	1
for	1
he	1
motioned	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
washing	1
them	1
i	1
quite	1
understood	1
my	1
only	1
doubt	1
was	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
any	1
dream	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
the	1
unnatural	1
horrible	1
net	1
of	1
gloom	1
and	1
mystery	1
which	1
seemed	1
closing	1
round	1
me	1
later	1
i	1
endorse	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
written	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
in	1
question	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
any	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
i	1
have	1
placed	1
the	1
crucifix	1
over	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
my	1
bed	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
my	1
rest	1
is	1
thus	1
freer	1
from	1
dreams	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
remain	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
not	1
hearing	1
any	1
sound	1
i	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
stone	1
stair	1
to	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
look	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
the	1
vast	1
expanse	1
inaccessible	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
narrow	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
courtyard	1
looking	1
out	1
on	1
this	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
indeed	1
in	1
prison	1
and	1
i	1
seemed	1
to	1
want	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
fresh	1
air	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
am	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
this	1
nocturnal	1
existence	1
tell	1
on	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
destroying	1
my	1
nerve	1
i	1
start	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
shadow	1
and	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
horrible	1
imaginings	1
god	1
knows	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
ground	1
for	1
my	1
terrible	1
fear	1
in	1
this	1
accursed	1
place	1
i	1
looked	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expanse	1
bathed	1
in	1
soft	1
yellow	1
moonlight	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
light	1
as	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
light	1
the	1
distant	1
hills	1
became	1
melted	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
and	1
gorges	1
of	1
velvety	1
blackness	1
the	1
mere	1
beauty	1
seemed	1
to	1
cheer	1
me	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
comfort	1
in	1
every	1
breath	1
i	1
drew	1
as	1
i	1
leaned	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
my	1
eye	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
something	1
moving	1
a	1
storey	1
below	1
me	1
and	1
somewhat	1
to	1
my	1
left	1
where	1
i	1
imagined	1
from	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
rooms	1
that	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
own	1
room	1
would	1
look	1
out	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
which	1
i	1
stood	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
deep	1
stonemullioned	1
and	1
though	1
weatherworn	1
was	1
still	1
complete	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evidently	1
many	1
a	1
day	1
since	1
the	1
case	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
i	1
drew	1
back	1
behind	1
the	1
stonework	1
and	1
looked	1
carefully	1
out	1
what	1
i	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
counts	1
head	1
coming	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
arms	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
mistake	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
opportunities	1
of	1
studying	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
interested	1
and	1
somewhat	1
amused	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
how	1
small	1
a	1
matter	1
will	1
interest	1
and	1
amuse	1
a	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prisoner	1
but	1
my	1
very	1
feelings	1
changed	1
to	1
repulsion	1
and	1
terror	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
man	1
slowly	1
emerge	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
crawl	1
down	1
the	1
castle	1
wall	1
over	1
that	1
dreadful	1
abyss	1
face	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
cloak	1
spreading	1
out	1
around	1
him	1
like	1
great	1
wings	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
my	1
eyes	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
trick	1
of	1
the	1
moonlight	1
some	1
weird	1
effect	1
of	1
shadow	1
but	1
i	1
kept	1
looking	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
delusion	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes	1
grasp	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
worn	1
clear	1
of	1
the	1
mortar	1
by	1
the	1
stress	1
of	1
years	1
and	1
by	1
thus	1
using	1
every	1
projection	1
and	1
inequality	1
move	1
downwards	1
with	1
considerable	1
speed	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
lizard	1
moves	1
along	1
a	1
wall	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
or	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
creature	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
man	1
i	1
feel	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
this	1
horrible	1
place	1
overpowering	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
fear	1
in	1
awful	1
fear	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
escape	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
encompassed	1
about	1
with	1
terrors	1
that	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
15	1
may	1
once	1
more	1
have	1
i	1
seen	1
the	1
count	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
lizard	1
fashion	1
he	1
moved	1
downwards	1
in	1
a	1
sidelong	1
way	1
some	1
hundred	1
feet	1
down	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
he	1
vanished	1
into	1
some	1
hole	1
or	1
window	1
when	1
his	1
head	1
had	1
disappeared	1
i	1
leaned	1
out	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
see	1
more	1
but	1
without	1
avail	1
the	1
distance	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
allow	1
a	1
proper	1
angle	1
of	1
sight	1
i	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
castle	1
now	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
explore	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
lamp	1
tried	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
locked	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
and	1
the	1
locks	1
were	1
comparatively	1
new	1
but	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
stone	1
stairs	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
entered	1
originally	1
i	1
found	1
i	1
could	1
pull	1
back	1
the	1
bolts	1
easily	1
enough	1
and	1
unhook	1
the	1
great	1
chains	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
locked	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
was	1
gone	1
that	1
key	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
i	1
must	1
watch	1
should	1
his	1
door	1
be	1
unlocked	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
get	1
it	1
and	1
escape	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
thorough	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
stairs	1
and	1
passages	1
and	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
doors	1
that	1
opened	1
from	1
them	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
small	1
rooms	1
near	1
the	1
hall	1
were	1
open	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
them	1
except	1
old	1
furniture	1
dusty	1
with	1
age	1
and	1
motheaten	1
at	1
last	1
however	1
i	1
found	1
one	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairway	1
which	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
locked	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
under	1
pressure	1
i	1
tried	1
it	1
harder	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
locked	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
resistance	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
hinges	1
had	1
fallen	1
somewhat	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
door	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
here	1
was	1
an	1
opportunity	1
which	1
i	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
again	1
so	1
i	1
exerted	1
myself	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
efforts	1
forced	1
it	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
enter	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
a	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
further	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
than	1
the	1
rooms	1
i	1
knew	1
and	1
a	1
storey	1
lower	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
suite	1
of	1
rooms	1
lay	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
room	1
looking	1
out	1
both	1
west	1
and	1
south	1
on	1
the	1
latter	1
side	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
precipice	1
the	1
castle	1
was	1
built	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
rock	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
three	1
sides	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impregnable	1
and	1
great	1
windows	1
were	1
placed	1
here	1
where	1
sling	1
or	1
bow	1
or	1
culverin	1
could	1
not	1
reach	1
and	1
consequently	1
light	1
and	1
comfort	1
impossible	1
to	1
a	1
position	1
which	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
guarded	1
were	1
secured	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
valley	1
and	1
then	1
rising	1
far	1
away	1
great	1
jagged	1
mountain	1
fastnesses	1
rising	1
peak	1
on	1
peak	1
the	1
sheer	1
rock	1
studded	1
with	1
mountain	1
ash	1
and	1
thorn	1
whose	1
roots	1
clung	1
in	1
cracks	1
and	1
crevices	1
and	1
crannies	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
this	1
was	1
evidently	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
bygone	1
days	1
for	1
the	1
furniture	1
had	1
more	1
air	1
of	1
comfort	1
than	1
any	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
curtainless	1
and	1
the	1
yellow	1
moonlight	1
flooding	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
diamond	1
panes	1
enabled	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
even	1
colours	1
whilst	1
it	1
softened	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
dust	1
which	1
lay	1
over	1
all	1
and	1
disguised	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
the	1
ravages	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
moth	1
my	1
lamp	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
effect	1
in	1
the	1
brilliant	1
moonlight	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dread	1
loneliness	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
chilled	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
nerves	1
tremble	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
living	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
hate	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
after	1
trying	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
school	1
my	1
nerves	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
soft	1
quietude	1
come	1
over	1
me	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
oak	1
table	1
where	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
possibly	1
some	1
fair	1
lady	1
sat	1
to	1
pen	1
with	1
much	1
thought	1
and	1
many	1
blushes	1
her	1
illspelt	1
loveletter	1
and	1
writing	1
in	1
my	1
diary	1
in	1
shorthand	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
since	1
i	1
closed	1
it	1
last	1
it	1
is	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
uptodate	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance	1
and	1
yet	1
unless	1
my	1
senses	1
deceive	1
me	1
the	1
old	1
centuries	1
had	1
and	1
have	1
powers	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
which	1
mere	1
modernity	1
cannot	1
kill	1
later	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
16	1
may	1
god	1
preserve	1
my	1
sanity	1
for	1
to	1
this	1
i	1
am	1
reduced	1
safety	1
and	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
safety	1
are	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
whilst	1
i	1
live	1
on	1
here	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
not	1
go	1
mad	1
if	1
indeed	1
i	1
be	1
not	1
mad	1
already	1
if	1
i	1
be	1
sane	1
then	1
surely	1
it	1
is	1
maddening	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
foul	1
things	1
that	1
lurk	1
in	1
this	1
hateful	1
place	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
dreadful	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
i	1
can	1
look	1
for	1
safety	1
even	1
though	1
this	1
be	1
only	1
whilst	1
i	1
can	1
serve	1
his	1
purpose	1
great	1
god	1
merciful	1
god	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
calm	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
way	1
lies	1
madness	1
indeed	1
i	1
begin	1
to	1
get	1
new	1
lights	1
on	1
certain	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
puzzled	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
i	1
never	1
quite	1
knew	1
what	1
shakespeare	1
meant	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
hamlet	1
say	1
my	1
tablets	1
quick	1
my	1
tablets	1
tis	1
meet	1
that	1
i	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
etc	1
for	1
now	1
feeling	1
as	1
though	1
my	1
own	1
brain	1
were	1
unhinged	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
shock	1
had	1
come	1
which	1
must	1
end	1
in	1
its	1
undoing	1
i	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
diary	1
for	1
repose	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
entering	1
accurately	1
must	1
help	1
to	1
soothe	1
me	1
the	1
counts	1
mysterious	1
warning	1
frightened	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
frightens	1
me	1
more	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
in	1
future	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
fearful	1
hold	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
fear	1
to	1
doubt	1
what	1
he	1
may	1
say	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
written	1
in	1
my	1
diary	1
and	1
had	1
fortunately	1
replaced	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
pen	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
i	1
felt	1
sleepy	1
the	1
counts	1
warning	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
but	1
i	1
took	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
disobeying	1
it	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
sleep	1
was	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
which	1
sleep	1
brings	1
as	1
outrider	1
the	1
soft	1
moonlight	1
soothed	1
and	1
the	1
wide	1
expanse	1
without	1
gave	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
freedom	1
which	1
refreshed	1
me	1
i	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
return	1
tonight	1
to	1
the	1
gloomhaunted	1
rooms	1
but	1
to	1
sleep	1
here	1
where	1
of	1
old	1
ladies	1
had	1
sat	1
and	1
sung	1
and	1
lived	1
sweet	1
lives	1
whilst	1
their	1
gentle	1
breasts	1
were	1
sad	1
for	1
their	1
menfolk	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
remorseless	1
wars	1
i	1
drew	1
a	1
great	1
couch	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
place	1
near	1
the	1
corner	1
so	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
lay	1
i	1
could	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
lovely	1
view	1
to	1
east	1
and	1
south	1
and	1
unthinking	1
of	1
and	1
uncaring	1
for	1
the	1
dust	1
composed	1
myself	1
for	1
sleep	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
i	1
hope	1
so	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
startlingly	1
real	1
so	1
real	1
that	1
now	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
full	1
sunlight	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
cannot	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
sleep	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
alone	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
unchanged	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
since	1
i	1
came	1
into	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
along	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
brilliant	1
moonlight	1
my	1
own	1
footsteps	1
marked	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
disturbed	1
the	1
long	1
accumulation	1
of	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
opposite	1
me	1
were	1
three	1
young	1
women	1
ladies	1
by	1
their	1
dress	1
and	1
manner	1
i	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
dreaming	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
them	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
moonlight	1
was	1
behind	1
them	1
they	1
threw	1
no	1
shadow	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
they	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
then	1
whispered	1
together	1
two	1
were	1
dark	1
and	1
had	1
high	1
aquiline	1
noses	1
like	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
great	1
dark	1
piercing	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
red	1
when	1
contrasted	1
with	1
the	1
pale	1
yellow	1
moon	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
fair	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
can	1
be	1
with	1
great	1
wavy	1
masses	1
of	1
golden	1
hair	1
and	1
eyes	1
like	1
pale	1
sapphires	1
i	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
some	1
dreamy	1
fear	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
recollect	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
how	1
or	1
where	1
all	1
three	1
had	1
brilliant	1
white	1
teeth	1
that	1
shone	1
like	1
pearls	1
against	1
the	1
ruby	1
of	1
their	1
voluptuous	1
lips	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
them	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
uneasy	1
some	1
longing	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
some	1
deadly	1
fear	1
i	1
felt	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
a	1
wicked	1
burning	1
desire	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
kiss	1
me	1
with	1
those	1
red	1
lips	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
note	1
this	1
down	1
lest	1
some	1
day	1
it	1
should	1
meet	1
minas	1
eyes	1
and	1
cause	1
her	1
pain	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
truth	1
they	1
whispered	1
together	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
laughed	1
such	1
a	1
silvery	1
musical	1
laugh	1
but	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
sound	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
come	1
through	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
human	1
lips	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
intolerable	1
tingling	1
sweetness	1
of	1
waterglasses	1
when	1
played	1
on	1
by	1
a	1
cunning	1
hand	1
the	1
fair	1
girl	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
coquettishly	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
urged	1
her	1
on	1
one	1
said	1
go	1
on	1
you	1
are	1
first	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
follow	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
other	1
added	1
he	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
strong	1
there	1
are	1
kisses	1
for	1
us	1
all	1
i	1
lay	1
quiet	1
looking	1
out	1
under	1
my	1
eyelashes	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
delightful	1
anticipation	1
the	1
fair	1
girl	1
advanced	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
me	1
till	1
i	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
breath	1
upon	1
me	1
sweet	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
honeysweet	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
same	1
tingling	1
through	1
the	1
nerves	1
as	1
her	1
voice	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
bitter	1
underlying	1
the	1
sweet	1
a	1
bitter	1
offensiveness	1
as	1
one	1
smells	1
in	1
blood	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
raise	1
my	1
eyelids	1
but	1
looked	1
out	1
and	1
saw	1
perfectly	1
under	1
the	1
lashes	1
the	1
girl	1
went	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
me	1
simply	1
gloating	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deliberate	1
voluptuousness	1
which	1
was	1
both	1
thrilling	1
and	1
repulsive	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
arched	1
her	1
neck	1
she	1
actually	1
licked	1
her	1
lips	1
like	1
an	1
animal	1
till	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
the	1
moisture	1
shining	1
on	1
the	1
scarlet	1
lips	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
tongue	1
as	1
it	1
lapped	1
the	1
white	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
went	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
the	1
lips	1
went	1
below	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
chin	1
and	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
fasten	1
on	1
my	1
throat	1
then	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
churning	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
tongue	1
as	1
it	1
licked	1
her	1
teeth	1
and	1
lips	1
and	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
hot	1
breath	1
on	1
my	1
neck	1
then	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
my	1
throat	1
began	1
to	1
tingle	1
as	1
ones	1
flesh	1
does	1
when	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
tickle	1
it	1
approaches	1
nearer	1
nearer	1
i	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
soft	1
shivering	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
on	1
the	1
supersensitive	1
skin	1
of	1
my	1
throat	1
and	1
the	1
hard	1
dents	1
of	1
two	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
just	1
touching	1
and	1
pausing	1
there	1
i	1
closed	1
my	1
eyes	1
in	1
a	1
languorous	1
ecstasy	1
and	1
waited	1
waited	1
with	1
beating	1
heart	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
another	1
sensation	1
swept	1
through	1
me	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
lightning	1
i	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
as	1
if	1
lapped	1
in	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
fury	1
as	1
my	1
eyes	1
opened	1
involuntarily	1
i	1
saw	1
his	1
strong	1
hand	1
grasp	1
the	1
slender	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
woman	1
and	1
with	1
giants	1
power	1
draw	1
it	1
back	1
the	1
blue	1
eyes	1
transformed	1
with	1
fury	1
the	1
white	1
teeth	1
champing	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
cheeks	1
blazing	1
red	1
with	1
passion	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
never	1
did	1
i	1
imagine	1
such	1
wrath	1
and	1
fury	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
demons	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
positively	1
blazing	1
the	1
red	1
light	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
lurid	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
hellfire	1
blazed	1
behind	1
them	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
deathly	1
pale	1
and	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
hard	1
like	1
drawn	1
wires	1
the	1
thick	1
eyebrows	1
that	1
met	1
over	1
the	1
nose	1
now	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
heaving	1
bar	1
of	1
whitehot	1
metal	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
sweep	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
hurled	1
the	1
woman	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
motioned	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
beating	1
them	1
back	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
imperious	1
gesture	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
wolves	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
though	1
low	1
and	1
almost	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
seemed	1
to	1
cut	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
then	1
ring	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
how	1
dare	1
you	1
touch	1
him	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
how	1
dare	1
you	1
cast	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
forbidden	1
it	1
back	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
this	1
man	1
belongs	1
to	1
me	1
beware	1
how	1
you	1
meddle	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
youll	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
fair	1
girl	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
of	1
ribald	1
coquetry	1
turned	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
you	1
yourself	1
never	1
loved	1
you	1
never	1
love	1
on	1
this	1
the	1
other	1
women	1
joined	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
mirthless	1
hard	1
soulless	1
laughter	1
rang	1
through	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
made	1
me	1
faint	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
fiends	1
then	1
the	1
count	1
turned	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
my	1
face	1
attentively	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
whisper	1
yes	1
i	1
too	1
can	1
love	1
you	1
yourselves	1
can	1
tell	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
past	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
now	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
done	1
with	1
him	1
you	1
shall	1
kiss	1
him	1
at	1
your	1
will	1
now	1
go	1
go	1
i	1
must	1
awaken	1
him	1
for	1
there	1

work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
tonight	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
laugh	1
as	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
bag	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
which	1
moved	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
living	1
thing	1
within	1
it	1
for	1
answer	1
he	1
nodded	1
his	1
head	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
jumped	1
forward	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
if	1
my	1
ears	1
did	1
not	1
deceive	1
me	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gasp	1
and	1
a	1
low	1
wall	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
halfsmothered	1
child	1
the	1
women	1
closed	1
round	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
aghast	1
with	1
horror	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
they	1
disappeared	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
dreadful	1
bag	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
door	1
near	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
passed	1
me	1
without	1
my	1
noticing	1
they	1
simply	1
seemed	1
to	1
fade	1
into	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
moonlight	1
and	1
pass	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
outside	1
the	1
dim	1
shadowy	1
forms	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
they	1
entirely	1
faded	1
away	1
then	1
the	1
horror	1
overcame	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
sank	1
down	1
unconscious	1
chapter	1
iv	1
jonathan	1
harkers	1
journal	1
i	1
awoke	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
bed	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
dreamt	1
the	1
count	1
must	1
have	1
carried	1
me	1
here	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
arrive	1
at	1
any	1
unquestionable	1
result	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
small	1
evidences	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
my	1
clothes	1
were	1
folded	1
and	1
laid	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
habit	1
my	1
watch	1
was	1
still	1
unwound	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
rigourously	1
accustomed	1
to	1
wind	1
it	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
details	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
no	1
proof	1
for	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
evidences	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
from	1
some	1
cause	1
or	1
another	1
i	1
had	1
certainly	1
been	1
much	1
upset	1
i	1
must	1
watch	1
for	1
proof	1
of	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
carried	1
me	1
here	1
and	1
undressed	1
me	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
hurried	1
in	1
his	1
task	1
for	1
my	1
pockets	1
are	1
intact	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
this	1
diary	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
brooked	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
or	1
destroyed	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
look	1
round	1
this	1
room	1
although	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
fear	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sanctuary	1
for	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
dreadful	1
than	1
those	1
awful	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
who	1
are	1
waiting	1
to	1
suck	1
my	1
blood	1
18	1
may	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
down	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
room	1
again	1
in	1
daylight	1
for	1
i	1
must	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
doorway	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
closed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
forcibly	1
driven	1
against	1
the	1
jamb	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
woodwork	1
was	1
splintered	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
bolt	1
of	1
the	1
lock	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
shot	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
fastened	1
from	1
the	1
inside	1
i	1
fear	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
dream	1
and	1
must	1
act	1
on	1
this	1
surmise	1
19	1
may	1
i	1
am	1
surely	1
in	1
the	1
toils	1
last	1
night	1
the	1
count	1
asked	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
suavest	1
tones	1
to	1
write	1
three	1
letters	1
one	1
saying	1
that	1
my	1
work	1
here	1
was	1
nearly	1
done	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
start	1
for	1
home	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
another	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
starting	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
arrived	1
at	1
bistritz	1
i	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
rebelled	1
but	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
madness	1
to	1
quarrel	1
openly	1
with	1
the	1
count	1
whilst	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
absolutely	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
to	1
refuse	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
excite	1
his	1
suspicion	1
and	1
to	1
arouse	1
his	1
anger	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
live	1
lest	1
i	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
him	1
my	1
only	1
chance	1
is	1
to	1
prolong	1
my	1
opportunities	1
something	1
may	1
occur	1
which	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
escape	1
i	1
saw	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
gathering	1
wrath	1
which	1
was	1
manifest	1
when	1
he	1
hurled	1
that	1
fair	1
woman	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
posts	1
were	1
few	1
and	1
uncertain	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
writing	1
now	1
would	1
ensure	1
ease	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
he	1
assured	1
me	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
impressiveness	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
countermand	1
the	1
later	1
letters	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
held	1
over	1
at	1
bistritz	1
until	1
due	1
time	1
in	1
case	1
chance	1
would	1
admit	1
of	1
my	1
prolonging	1
my	1
stay	1
that	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
create	1
new	1
suspicion	1
i	1
therefore	1
pretended	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
views	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
dates	1
i	1
should	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
letters	1
he	1
calculated	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
first	1
should	1
be	1
june	1
12	1
the	1
second	1
june	1
19	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
june	1
29	1
i	1
know	1
now	1
the	1
span	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
god	1
help	1
me	1
28	1
may	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
escape	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
send	1
word	1
home	1
a	1

he	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
smoothest	1
voice	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
two	1
letters	1
the	1

me	1
these	1
of	1

not	1
whence	1
they	1
come	1
i	1
shall	1
of	1
course	1
take	1
care	1
see	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
one	1

from	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
peter	1
hawkins	1
the	1
other	1
here	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
symbols	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
look	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
blazed	1
wickedly	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
a	1
vile	1
thing	1
an	1
outrage	1
upon	1
friendship	1
and	1
hospitality	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
signed	1
well	1
so	1
it	1
cannot	1
matter	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
calmly	1
held	1
letter	1
and	1
envelope	1
in	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
consumed	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
hawkins	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
of	1
course	1
send	1
on	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
yours	1
your	1
letters	1
are	1
sacred	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
pardon	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
unknowingly	1
i	1
did	1
break	1
the	1
seal	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
cover	1
it	1
again	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1
bow	1
handed	1
me	1
a	1
clean	1
envelope	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
redirect	1
it	1
and	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
key	1
turn	1
softly	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
i	1
went	1
over	1
and	1
tried	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
locked	1
when	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
two	1
after	1
the	1
count	1
came	1
quietly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
his	1
coming	1
wakened	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
courteous	1
and	1
very	1
cheery	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
sleeping	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
my	1
friend	1
you	1
are	1
tired	1
get	1
to	1
bed	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
surest	1
rest	1
i	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
to	1
talk	1
tonight	1
since	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
labours	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
sleep	1
i	1
pray	1
i	1
passed	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
slept	1
without	1
dreaming	1
despair	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
calms	1
31	1
may	1
this	1
morning	1
when	1
i	1
woke	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
provide	1
myself	1
with	1
some	1
paper	1
and	1
envelopes	1
from	1
my	1
bag	1
and	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
write	1
in	1
case	1
i	1
should	1
get	1
an	1
opportunity	1
but	1
again	1
a	1
surprise	1
again	1
a	1
shock	1
every	1
scrap	1
of	1
paper	1
was	1
gone	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
all	1
my	1
notes	1
my	1
memoranda	1
relating	1
to	1
railways	1
and	1
travel	1
my	1
letter	1
of	1
credit	1
in	1
fact	1
all	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
were	1
i	1
once	1
outside	1
the	1
castle	1
i	1
sat	1
and	1
pondered	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
then	1
some	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
made	1
search	1
of	1
my	1
portmanteau	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wardrobe	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
placed	1
my	1
clothes	1
the	1
suit	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
travelled	1
was	1
gone	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
overcoat	1
and	1
rug	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
them	1
anywhere	1
this	1
looked	1
like	1
some	1
new	1
scheme	1
of	1
villainy	1
17	1
june	1
this	1
morning	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
my	1
bed	1
cudgelling	1
my	1
brains	1
i	1
heard	1
without	1
a	1
cracking	1
of	1
whips	1
and	1
pounding	1
and	1
scraping	1
of	1
horses	1
feet	1
up	1
the	1
rocky	1
path	1
beyond	1
the	1
courtyard	1
with	1
joy	1
i	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
drive	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
two	1
great	1
leiterwagons	1
each	1
drawn	1
by	1
eight	1
sturdy	1
horses	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
each	1
pair	1
of	1
slovak	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
great	1
nailstudded	1
belt	1
dirty	1
sheepskin	1
and	1
high	1
boots	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
their	1
long	1
staves	1
in	1
hand	1
i	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
intending	1
to	1
descend	1
and	1
try	1
and	1
join	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
main	1
hall	1
as	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
way	1
might	1
be	1
opened	1
for	1
them	1
again	1
a	1
shock	1
my	1
door	1
was	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
then	1
i	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
cried	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
me	1
stupidly	1
and	1
pointed	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
hetman	1
of	1
the	1
szgany	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
seeing	1
them	1
pointing	1
to	1
my	1
window	1
said	1
something	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
laughed	1
henceforth	1
no	1
effort	1
of	1
mine	1
no	1
piteous	1
cry	1
or	1
agonised	1
entreaty	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
they	1
resolutely	1
turned	1
away	1
the	1
leiterwagons	1
contained	1
great	1
square	1
boxes	1
with	1
handles	1
of	1
thick	1
rope	1
these	1
were	1
evidently	1
empty	1
by	1
the	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
slovaks	1
handled	1
them	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
resonance	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
roughly	1
moved	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
unloaded	1
and	1
packed	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
the	1
slovaks	1
were	1
given	1
some	1
money	1
by	1
the	1
szgany	1
and	1
spitting	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
luck	1
lazily	1
went	1
each	1
to	1
his	1
horses	1
head	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
their	1
whips	1
die	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
24	1
june	1
before	1
morning	1
last	1
night	1
the	1
count	1
left	1
me	1
early	1
and	1
locked	1
himself	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
dared	1
i	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
winding	1
stair	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
opened	1
south	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
going	1
on	1
the	1
szgany	1
are	1
quartered	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
are	1
doing	1
work	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
for	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
hear	1
a	1
faraway	1
muffled	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
mattock	1
and	1
spade	1
and	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
some	1
ruthless	1
villainy	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
somewhat	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
something	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
window	1
i	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
watched	1
carefully	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
man	1
emerge	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
shock	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
worn	1
whilst	1
travelling	1
here	1
and	1
slung	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
the	1
terrible	1
bag	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
women	1
take	1
away	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
quest	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
garb	1
too	1
this	1
then	1
is	1
his	1
new	1
scheme	1
of	1
evil	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
allow	1
others	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
think	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
both	1
leave	1
evidence	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
towns	1
or	1
villages	1
posting	1
my	1
own	1
letters	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
wickedness	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
shall	1
by	1
the	1
local	1
people	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
rage	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
can	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
whilst	1
i	1
am	1
shut	1
up	1
here	1
a	1
veritable	1
prisoner	1
but	1
without	1
that	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
criminals	1
right	1
and	1
consolation	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
counts	1
return	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
sat	1
doggedly	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
then	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
quaint	1
little	1
specks	1
floating	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
moonlight	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
tiniest	1
grains	1
of	1
dust	1
and	1
they	1
whirled	1
round	1
and	1
gathered	1
in	1
clusters	1
in	1
a	1
nebulous	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
i	1
watched	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
soothing	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
calm	1
stole	1
over	1
me	1
i	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
embrasure	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
comfortable	1
position	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
enjoy	1
more	1
fully	1
the	1
aerial	1
gambolling	1
something	1
made	1
me	1
start	1
up	1
a	1
low	1
piteous	1
howling	1
of	1
dogs	1
somewhere	1
far	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
louder	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
ring	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
the	1
floating	1
motes	1
of	1
dust	1
to	1
take	1
new	1
shapes	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
as	1
they	1
danced	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
i	1
felt	1
myself	1
struggling	1
to	1
awake	1
to	1
some	1
call	1
of	1
my	1
instincts	1
may	1
my	1
very	1
soul	1
was	1
struggling	1
and	1
my	1
halfremembered	1
sensibilities	1
were	1
striving	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
call	1
i	1
was	1
becoming	1
hypnotised	1
quicker	1
and	1
quicker	1
danced	1
the	1
dust	1
the	1
moonbeams	1
seemed	1
to	1
quiver	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
by	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
gloom	1
beyond	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
they	1
gathered	1
till	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
dim	1
phantom	1
shapes	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
started	1
broad	1
awake	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
possession	1
of	1
my	1
senses	1
and	1
ran	1
screaming	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
the	1
phantom	1
shapes	1
which	1
were	1
becoming	1
gradually	1
materialised	1
from	1
the	1
moonbeams	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
ghostly	1
women	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
doomed	1
i	1
fled	1
and	1
felt	1
somewhat	1
safer	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
moonlight	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
brightly	1
when	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
had	1
passed	1
i	1
heard	1
something	1
stirring	1
in	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
sharp	1
wail	1
quickly	1
suppressed	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
deep	1
awful	1
silence	1
which	1
chilled	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
beating	1
heart	1
i	1
tried	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
locked	1
in	1
my	1
prison	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
simply	1
cried	1
as	1
i	1
sat	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
without	1
the	1
agonised	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
i	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
throwing	1
it	1
up	1
peered	1
out	1
between	1
the	1
bars	1
there	1
indeed	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
dishevelled	1
hair	1
holding	1
her	1
hands	1
over	1
her	1
heart	1
as	1
one	1
distressed	1
with	1
running	1
she	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
gateway	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
my	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
forward	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
laden	1
with	1
menace	1
monster	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
child	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
raising	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
cried	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
in	1
tones	1
which	1
wrung	1
my	1
heart	1
then	1
she	1
tore	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
beat	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
abandoned	1
herself	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
violences	1
of	1
extravagant	1
emotion	1
finally	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
forward	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
beating	1
of	1
her	1
naked	1
hands	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
somewhere	1
high	1
overhead	1
probably	1
on	1
the	1
tower	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
calling	1
in	1
his	1
harsh	1
metallic	1
whisper	1
his	1
call	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
answered	1
from	1
far	1
and	1
wide	1
by	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
wolves	1
before	1
many	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
them	1
poured	1
like	1
a	1
pentup	1
dam	1
when	1
liberated	1
through	1
the	1
wide	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
was	1
but	1
short	1
before	1
long	1
they	1
streamed	1
away	1
singly	1
licking	1
their	1
lips	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
pity	1
her	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
now	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
child	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
better	1
dead	1
what	1
shall	1
i	1
do	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
do	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
dreadful	1
thrall	1
of	1
night	1
and	1
gloom	1
and	1
fear	1

from	1
the	1

dear	1
to	1
his	1

the	1

the	1
sun	1
grew	1
so	1
high	1
this	1

that	1
it	1
struck	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
gateway	1
opposite	1
my	1
window	1
the	1
high	1
spot	1
which	1
it	1
touched	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
dove	1
from	1
the	1
ark	1
had	1
lighted	1
there	1
my	1
fear	1
fell	1
from	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
vapourous	1
garment	1
which	1
dissolved	1
in	1
the	1
warmth	1
i	1
must	1
take	1
action	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
whilst	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
upon	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
one	1
of	1

went	1
to	1
post	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
that	1
fatal	1
series	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
blot	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
traces	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
from	1
the	1

me	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1

in	1
some	1
way	1
in	1
danger	1
or	1
in	1

i	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
the	1

in	1
the	1
daylight	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
sleeps	1
when	1
others	1
wake	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
awake	1
whilst	1
they	1
sleep	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
into	1

is	1

there	1
is	1
a	1
way	1

it	1

his	1

another	1

seen	1
him	1
myself	1
crawl	1
from	1
his	1
window	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
i	1
imitate	1
him	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
by	1
his	1
window	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
desperate	1
but	1
my	1
need	1
is	1
more	1
desperate	1
still	1
i	1
shall	1
risk	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
worst	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
death	1
and	1
a	1

death	1
is	1
not	1

the	1
dreaded	1

all	1
and	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
mina	1
same	1
day	1
later	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
effort	1
and	1
god	1
helping	1
me	1
have	1
come	1
safely	1
back	1
to	1
this	1
room	1
i	1
must	1
put	1
down	1
every	1
detail	1
in	1
order	1
i	1
went	1
whilst	1
my	1
courage	1
was	1
fresh	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
got	1
outside	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
ledge	1
of	1
stone	1
which	1
runs	1
round	1
the	1
building	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
stones	1
are	1
big	1
and	1
roughly	1
cut	1
and	1
the	1
mortar	1
has	1
by	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
been	1
washed	1
away	1
between	1
them	1
i	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
boots	1
and	1
ventured	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
desperate	1
way	1
i	1
looked	1
down	1
once	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
a	1
sudden	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
awful	1
depth	1
would	1
not	1
overcome	1
me	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
kept	1
my	1
eyes	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
i	1
knew	1
pretty	1
well	1
the	1
direction	1
and	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
window	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
having	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
opportunities	1
available	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
dizzy	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
was	1
too	1
excited	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
ridiculously	1
short	1
till	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
windowsill	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
sash	1
i	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
agitation	1
however	1
when	1
i	1
bent	1
down	1
and	1
slid	1
feet	1
foremost	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
then	1
i	1
looked	1
around	1
for	1
the	1
count	1
but	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
gladness	1
made	1
a	1
discovery	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
empty	1
it	1
was	1
barely	1
furnished	1
with	1
odd	1
things	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
used	1
the	1
furniture	1
was	1
something	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
as	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
rooms	1
and	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
dust	1
i	1
looked	1
for	1
the	1
key	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
lock	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
anywhere	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
found	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
gold	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
roman	1
and	1
british	1
and	1
austrian	1
and	1
hungarian	1
and	1
greek	1
and	1
turkish	1
money	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
film	1
of	1
dust	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
lain	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
noticed	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
years	1
old	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
chains	1
and	1
ornaments	1
some	1
jewelled	1
but	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
old	1
and	1
stained	1
at	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
door	1
i	1
tried	1
it	1
for	1
since	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
or	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
door	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
main	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
search	1
i	1
must	1
make	1
further	1
examination	1
or	1
all	1
my	1
efforts	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
it	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
led	1
through	1
a	1
stone	1
passage	1
to	1
a	1
circular	1
stairway	1
which	1
went	1
steeply	1
down	1
i	1
descended	1
minding	1
carefully	1
where	1
i	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
dark	1
being	1
only	1
lit	1
by	1
loopholes	1
in	1
the	1
heavy	1
masonry	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dark	1
tunnellike	1
passage	1
through	1
which	1
came	1
a	1
deathly	1
sickly	1
odour	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
old	1
earth	1
newly	1
turned	1
as	1
i	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
passage	1
the	1
smell	1
grew	1
closer	1
and	1
heavier	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
pulled	1
open	1
a	1
heavy	1
door	1
which	1
stood	1
a	1
jar	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
ruined	1
chapel	1
which	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
graveyard	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
broken	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
places	1
were	1
steps	1
leading	1
to	1
vaults	1
but	1
the	1
ground	1
had	1
recently	1
been	1
dug	1
over	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
placed	1
in	1
great	1
wooden	1
boxes	1
manifestly	1
those	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
slovaks	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
about	1
and	1
i	1
made	1
search	1
for	1
any	1
further	1
outlet	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
then	1
i	1
went	1
over	1
every	1
inch	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
chance	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
vaults	1
where	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
struggled	1
although	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
was	1
a	1
dread	1
to	1
my	1
very	1
soul	1
into	1
two	1
of	1
these	1
i	1
went	1
but	1
saw	1
nothing	1
except	1
fragments	1
of	1
old	1
coffins	1
and	1
piles	1
of	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
however	1
i	1
made	1
a	1
discovery	1
there	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
boxes	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
fifty	1
in	1
all	1
on	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
newly	1
dug	1
earth	1
lay	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
was	1
either	1
dead	1
or	1
asleep	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
which	1
for	1
the	1
eyes	1
were	1
open	1
and	1
stony	1
but	1
without	1
the	1
glassiness	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
cheeks	1
had	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
life	1
through	1
all	1
their	1
pallor	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
ever	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
movement	1
no	1
pulse	1
no	1
breath	1
no	1
beating	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
lain	1
there	1
long	1
for	1
the	1
earthy	1
smell	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
its	1
cover	1
pierced	1
with	1
holes	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
search	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
dead	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
dead	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
such	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
hate	1
though	1
unconscious	1
of	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
presence	1
that	1
i	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
leaving	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
crawled	1
again	1
up	1
the	1
castle	1
wall	1
regaining	1
my	1
room	1
chamber	1
i	1
threw	1
myself	1
panting	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
29	1
june	1
today	1
is	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
taken	1
steps	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
genuine	1
for	1
again	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
leave	1
the	1
castle	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
window	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
clothes	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
lizard	1
fashion	1
i	1
wished	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
gun	1
or	1
some	1
lethal	1
weapon	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
no	1
weapon	1
wrought	1
alone	1
by	1
mans	1
hand	1
would	1
have	1
any	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
return	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
weird	1
sisters	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
and	1
read	1
there	1
till	1
i	1
fell	1
asleep	1
i	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
grimly	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
tomorrow	1
my	1
friend	1
we	1
must	1
part	1
you	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
beautiful	1
england	1
i	1
to	1
some	1
work	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
end	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
never	1
meet	1
your	1
letter	1
home	1
has	1
been	1
despatched	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
here	1
but	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
your	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
come	1
the	1
szgany	1
who	1
have	1
some	1
labours	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
here	1
and	1
also	1
come	1
some	1
slovaks	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
my	1
carriage	1
shall	1
come	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
bear	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
diligence	1
from	1
bukovina	1
to	1
bistritz	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
you	1
at	1
castle	1
dracula	1
i	1
suspected	1
him	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
test	1
his	1
sincerity	1
sincerity	1
it	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
profanation	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
write	1
it	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
monster	1
so	1
asked	1
him	1
pointblank	1
why	1
may	1
i	1
not	1
go	1
tonight	1
because	1
dear	1
sir	1
my	1
coachman	1
and	1
horses	1
are	1
away	1
on	1
a	1
mission	1
but	1
i	1
would	1
walk	1
with	1
pleasure	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
smiled	1
such	1
a	1
soft	1
smooth	1
diabolical	1
smile	1
that	1
i	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
trick	1
behind	1
his	1
smoothness	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
your	1
baggage	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
it	1
i	1
can	1
send	1
for	1
it	1
some	1
other	1
time	1
the	1
count	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sweet	1
courtesy	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
rub	1
my	1
eyes	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
real	1
you	1
english	1
have	1
a	1
saying	1
which	1
is	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
for	1
its	1
spirit	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
rules	1
our	1
boyars	1
welcome	1
the	1
coming	1
speed	1
the	1
parting	1
guest	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
friend	1
not	1
an	1
hour	1
shall	1
you	1
wait	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
against	1
your	1
will	1
though	1
sad	1
am	1
i	1
at	1
your	1
going	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
so	1
suddenly	1
desire	1
it	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
stately	1
gravity	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
lamp	1
preceded	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
hall	1
suddenly	1
he	1
stopped	1
hark	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
came	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
many	1
wolves	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sound	1
sprang	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
orchestra	1
seems	1
to	1
leap	1
under	1
the	1
baton	1
of	1
the	1
conductor	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
proceeded	1
in	1
his	1
stately	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
ponderous	1
bolts	1
unhooked	1
the	1
heavy	1
chains	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
open	1
to	1
my	1
intense	1
astonishment	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
unlocked	1
suspiciously	1
i	1
looked	1
all	1
round	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
key	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
began	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
without	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
angrier	1
their	1
red	1
jaws	1
with	1
champing	1
teeth	1
and	1
their	1
bluntclawed	1
feet	1
as	1
they	1
leaped	1
came	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
opening	1
door	1
i	1
knew	1
then	1
that	1
to	1
struggle	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
against	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
useless	1
with	1
such	1
allies	1
as	1
these	1
at	1
his	1
command	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
door	1
continued	1
slowly	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
counts	1
body	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
gap	1
suddenly	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
means	1
of	1
my	1
doom	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
wolves	1
and	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
instigation	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
diabolical	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
great	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
last	1
chance	1
i	1
cried	1
out	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
shall	1
wait	1
till	1
morning	1
and	1
covered	1
my	1
face	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
to	1
hide	1
my	1
tears	1
of	1
bitter	1
disappointment	1
with	1
one	1
sweep	1
of	1
his	1
powerful	1
arm	1
the	1
count	1
threw	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
bolts	1
clanged	1
and	1
echoed	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
as	1
they	1
shot	1
back	1
into	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
silence	1
we	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
the	1
last	1
i	1
saw	1
of	1
count	1
dracula	1
was	1
his	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
light	1
of	1
triumph	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
judas	1
in	1
hell	1
might	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
whispering	1
at	1
my	1
door	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
it	1
softly	1
and	1
listened	1
unless	1
my	1
ears	1
deceived	1
me	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
back	1
back	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
place	1
your	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
wait	1
have	1
patience	1
tonight	1
is	1
mine	1
tomorrow	1
night	1
is	1
yours	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
sweet	1
ripple	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
i	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
saw	1
without	1
the	1
three	1
terrible	1
women	1
licking	1
their	1
lips	1
as	1
i	1
appeared	1
they	1
all	1
joined	1
in	1
a	1
horrible	1
laugh	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
it	1
is	1
then	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
end	1
tomorrow	1
tomorrow	1
lord	1
help	1
me	1
and	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
am	1
dear	1
30	1
june	1
morning	1
these	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
i	1
ever	1
write	1
in	1
this	1
diary	1
i	1
slept	1
till	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
dawn	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
woke	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
for	1
i	1
determined	1
that	1
if	1
death	1
came	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
me	1
ready	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
subtle	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
come	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
welcome	1
cockcrow	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
safe	1
with	1
a	1
glad	1
heart	1
i	1
opened	1
my	1
door	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
unlocked	1
and	1
now	1
escape	1
was	1
before	1
me	1
with	1
hands	1
that	1
trembled	1
with	1
eagerness	1
i	1
unhooked	1
the	1
chains	1
and	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
massive	1
bolts	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
would	1
not	1
move	1
despair	1
seized	1
me	1
i	1
pulled	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
shook	1
it	1
till	1
massive	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
it	1
rattled	1
in	1
its	1
casement	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
bolt	1
shot	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
locked	1
after	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
count	1
then	1
a	1
wild	1
desire	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
key	1
at	1
any	1
risk	1
and	1
i	1
determined	1
then	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
scale	1
the	1
wall	1
again	1
and	1
gain	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
he	1
might	1
kill	1
me	1
but	1
death	1
now	1
seemed	1
the	1
happier	1
choice	1
of	1
evils	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
i	1
rushed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
window	1
and	1
scrambled	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
as	1
before	1
into	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
empty	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
i	1
expected	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
key	1
anywhere	1
but	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
gold	1
remained	1
i	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
winding	1
stair	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
dark	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
chapel	1
i	1
knew	1
now	1
well	1
enough	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
monster	1
i	1
sought	1
the	1
great	1
box	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
close	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
but	1
the	1
lid	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
it	1
not	1
fastened	1
down	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
nails	1
ready	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
to	1
be	1
hammered	1
home	1
i	1
knew	1
i	1
must	1
reach	1
the	1
body	1
for	1
the	1
key	1
so	1
i	1
raised	1
the	1
lid	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
saw	1
something	1
which	1
filled	1
my	1
very	1
soul	1
with	1
horror	1
there	1
lay	1
the	1
count	1
but	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
youth	1
had	1
been	1
half	1
renewed	1
for	1
the	1
white	1
hair	1
and	1
moustache	1
were	1
changed	1
to	1
dark	1
irongrey	1
the	1
cheeks	1
were	1
fuller	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
skin	1
seemed	1
rubyred	1
underneath	1
the	1
mouth	1
was	1
redder	1
than	1
ever	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
gouts	1
of	1
fresh	1
blood	1
which	1
trickled	1
from	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
and	1
ran	1
over	1
the	1
chin	1
and	1
neck	1
even	1
the	1
deep	1
burning	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
set	1
amongst	1
swollen	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
lids	1
and	1
pouches	1
underneath	1
were	1
bloated	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
awful	1
creature	1
were	1
simply	1
gorged	1
with	1
blood	1
he	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
filthy	1
leech	1
exhausted	1
with	1
his	1
repletion	1
i	1
shuddered	1
as	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
to	1
touch	1
him	1
and	1
every	1
sense	1
in	1
me	1
revolted	1
at	1
the	1
contact	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
search	1
or	1
i	1
was	1
lost	1
the	1
coming	1
night	1
might	1
see	1
my	1
own	1
body	1
a	1
banquet	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
way	1
to	1
those	1
horrid	1
three	1
i	1
felt	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
body	1
but	1
no	1
sign	1
could	1
i	1
find	1
of	1
the	1
key	1
then	1
i	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mocking	1
smile	1
on	1
the	1
bloated	1
face	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
drive	1
me	1
mad	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
being	1
i	1
was	1
helping	1
to	1
transfer	1
to	1
london	1
where	1
perhaps	1
for	1
centuries	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
might	1
amongst	1
its	1
teeming	1
millions	1
satiate	1
his	1
lust	1
for	1
blood	1
and	1
create	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
everwidening	1
circle	1
of	1
semidemons	1
to	1
batten	1
on	1
the	1
helpless	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
drove	1
me	1
mad	1
a	1
terrible	1
desire	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
rid	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
monster	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
lethal	1
weapon	1
at	1
hand	1
but	1
i	1
seized	1
a	1
shovel	1
which	1
the	1
workmen	1
had	1
been	1
using	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
cases	1
and	1
lifting	1
it	1
high	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
downward	1
at	1
the	1
hateful	1
face	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
head	1
turned	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
fell	1
full	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
blaze	1
of	1
basilisk	1
horror	1
the	1
sight	1
seemed	1
to	1
paralyse	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
shovel	1
turned	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
glanced	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
merely	1
making	1
a	1
deep	1
gash	1
above	1
the	1
forehead	1
the	1
shovel	1
fell	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
across	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
pulled	1
it	1
away	1
the	1
flange	1
of	1
the	1
blade	1
caught	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
lid	1
which	1
fell	1
over	1
again	1
and	1
hid	1
the	1
horrid	1
thing	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
the	1
last	1
glimpse	1
i	1
had	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
bloated	1
face	1
bloodstained	1
and	1
fixed	1
with	1
a	1
grin	1
of	1
malice	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
held	1
its	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
nethermost	1
hell	1
i	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
my	1
next	1
move	1
but	1
my	1
brain	1
seemed	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
i	1
waited	1
with	1
a	1
despairing	1
feeling	1
growing	1
over	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
waited	1
i	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
a	1
gipsy	1
song	1
sung	1
by	1
merry	1
voices	1
coming	1
closer	1
and	1
through	1
their	1
song	1
the	1
rolling	1
of	1
heavy	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
whips	1
the	1
szgany	1
and	1
the	1
slovaks	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
spoken	1
were	1
coming	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
look	1
around	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
vile	1
body	1
i	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
gained	1
the	1
counts	1
room	1
determined	1
to	1
rush	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
should	1
be	1
opened	1
with	1
strained	1
ears	1
i	1
listened	1
and	1
heard	1
downstairs	1
the	1
grinding	1
of	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
lock	1
and	1
the	1
falling	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
door	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
other	1
means	1
of	1
entry	1
or	1
some	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
key	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
locked	1
doors	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
feet	1
tramping	1
and	1
dying	1
away	1
in	1
some	1
passage	1
which	1
sent	1
up	1
a	1
clanging	1
echo	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
run	1
down	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
vault	1
where	1
i	1
might	1
find	1
the	1
new	1
entrance	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
a	1
violent	1
puff	1
of	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
winding	1
stair	1
blew	1
to	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
that	1
set	1
the	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
lintels	1
flying	1
when	1
i	1
ran	1
to	1
push	1
it	1
open	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hopelessly	1
fast	1
i	1
was	1
again	1
a	1
prisoner	1
and	1
the	1
net	1
of	1
doom	1
was	1
closing	1
round	1
me	1
more	1
closely	1
as	1
i	1
write	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
below	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
tramping	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
weights	1
being	1
set	1
down	1
heavily	1
doubtless	1
the	1
boxes	1
with	1
their	1
freight	1
of	1
earth	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
hammering	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
box	1
being	1
nailed	1
down	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
hear	1
the	1
heavy	1
feet	1
tramping	1
again	1
along	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
idle	1
feet	1
coming	1
behind	1
them	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
shut	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
rattle	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
grinding	1
of	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
lock	1
i	1
can	1
hear	1
the	1
key	1
withdraw	1
then	1
another	1
door	1
opens	1
and	1
shuts	1
i	1
hear	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
lock	1
and	1
bolt	1
hark	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
rocky	1
way	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
heavy	1
wheels	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
whips	1
and	1
the	1
chorus	1
of	1
the	1
szgany	1
as	1
they	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
i	1

my	1
dearest	1
mina	1
i	1
must	1
say	1
you	1
tax	1
me	1
very	1
unfairly	1
with	1
being	1
a	1
bad	1
correspondent	1
i	1
wrote	1
to	1
you	1
twice	1
since	1

besides	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1

pleasant	1
just	1
now	1
and	1

a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
picturegalleries	1
and	1
for	1
walks	1
and	1
rides	1
in	1
the	1
park	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
tall	1
curlyhaired	1
man	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
pop	1
some	1
one	1
has	1
evidently	1
been	1
telling	1
tales	1
that	1
was	1
mr	1
holmwood	1
he	1
often	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
mamma	1
get	1
on	1
very	1
well	1
together	1
they	1
have	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
in	1
common	1
we	1
met	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
would	1
just	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
already	1
engaged	1
to	1
jonathan	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
parti	1
being	1
handsome	1
well	1
off	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
birth	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
really	1
clever	1
just	1
fancy	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
nineandtwenty	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
an	1
immense	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
all	1
under	1
his	1
own	1
care	1
mr	1
holmwood	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
here	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
and	1
often	1
comes	1
now	1
i	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
men	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
most	1
calm	1
he	1
seems	1
absolutely	1
imperturbable	1
i	1
can	1
fancy	1
what	1
a	1
wonderful	1
power	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
over	1
his	1
patients	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
curious	1
habit	1
of	1
looking	1
one	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
ones	1
thoughts	1
he	1
tries	1
this	1
on	1
very	1
much	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
flatter	1
myself	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
a	1
tough	1
nut	1
to	1
crack	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
from	1
my	1
glass	1
do	1
you	1
ever	1
try	1
to	1
read	1
your	1
own	1
face	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
study	1
and	1
gives	1
you	1
more	1
trouble	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
well	1
fancy	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
tried	1
it	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
i	1
afford	1
him	1
a	1
curious	1
psychological	1
study	1
and	1
i	1
humbly	1
think	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
take	1
sufficient	1
interest	1

dress	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
describe	1

sorts	1
of	1
extravagant	1
ideas	1
and	1
imagining	1
themselves	1

wives	1
to	1

quite	1
as	1

women	1
i	1

afraid	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
quite	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
number	1
one	1
came	1
just	1
before	1
lunch	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
him	1
dr	1
john	1
seward	1
the	1
lunaticasylum	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
strong	1
jaw	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
forehead	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
cool	1
outwardly	1
but	1
was	1
nervous	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
schooling	1
himself	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
little	1
things	1
and	1
remembered	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
almost	1
managed	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
silk	1
hat	1
which	1
men	1
dont	1
generally	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
cool	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
appear	1
at	1
ease	1
he	1
kept	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
lancet	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
nearly	1
scream	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
mina	1
very	1
straightforwardly	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
dear	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
me	1
so	1
little	1
and	1
what	1
his	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
cheer	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
unhappy	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
cry	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
brute	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
add	1
to	1
my	1
present	1
trouble	1
then	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
love	1
him	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
his	1
hands	1
trembled	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
some	1
hesitation	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
cared	1
already	1
for	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
very	1
nicely	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
wring	1
my	1
confidence	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
know	1
because	1
if	1
a	1
womans	1
heart	1
was	1
free	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
hope	1
and	1
then	1
mina	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
duty	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
one	1
i	1
only	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
much	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
strong	1
and	1
very	1
grave	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
both	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
hoped	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
ever	1
wanted	1
a	1
friend	1
i	1
must	1
count	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
best	1
oh	1
mina	1
dear	1
i	1
cant	1
help	1
crying	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
this	1
letter	1
being	1
all	1
blotted	1
being	1
proposed	1
to	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
but	1
it	1
isnt	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
happy	1
thing	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
poor	1
fellow	1
whom	1
you	1
know	1
loves	1
you	1
honestly	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
looking	1
all	1
brokenhearted	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
matter	1
what	1
he	1
may	1
say	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
you	1
are	1
passing	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
must	1
stop	1
here	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
feel	1
so	1
miserable	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
evening	1
arthur	1
has	1
just	1
gone	1
and	1
i	1
feel	1
in	1
better	1
spirits	1
than	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
off	1
so	1
i	1
can	1
go	1
on	1
telling	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
day	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
number	1
two	1
came	1
after	1
lunch	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
fellow	1
an	1
american	1
from	1
texas	1
and	1
he	1
looks	1
so	1
young	1
and	1
so	1
fresh	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
almost	1
impossible	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
so	1
many	1
places	1
and	1
has	1
had	1
such	1
adventures	1
i	1
sympathize	1
with	1
poor	1
desdemona	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
dangerous	1
stream	1
poured	1
in	1
her	1
ear	1
even	1
by	1
a	1
black	1
man	1
i	1
suppose	1
that	1
we	1
women	1
are	1
such	1
cowards	1
that	1
we	1
think	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
fears	1
and	1
we	1
marry	1
him	1
i	1
know	1
now	1
what	1
i	1
would	1
do	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
girl	1
love	1
me	1
no	1
i	1
dont	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
mr	1
morris	1
telling	1
us	1
his	1
stories	1
and	1
arthur	1
never	1
told	1
any	1
and	1
yet	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
am	1
somewhat	1
previous	1
mr	1
quincey	1
p	1
morris	1
found	1
me	1
alone	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
always	1
does	1
find	1
a	1
girl	1
alone	1
no	1
he	1
doesnt	1
for	1
arthur	1
tried	1
twice	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
chance	1
and	1
i	1
helping	1
him	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
now	1
i	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
beforehand	1
that	1
mr	1
morris	1
doesnt	1
always	1
speak	1
slang	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
never	1
does	1
so	1
to	1
strangers	1
or	1
before	1
them	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
well	1
educated	1
and	1
has	1
exquisite	1
manners	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
it	1
amused	1
me	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
talk	1
american	1
slang	1
and	1
whenever	1
i	1
was	1
present	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
shocked	1
he	1
said	1
such	1
funny	1
things	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
invent	1
it	1
all	1
for	1
it	1
fits	1
exactly	1
into	1
whatever	1
else	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
slang	1
has	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
myself	1
if	1
i	1
shall	1
ever	1
speak	1
slang	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
arthur	1
likes	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
him	1
use	1
any	1
as	1
yet	1
well	1
mr	1
morris	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
me	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
jolly	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
nervous	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
said	1
ever	1
so	1
sweetly	1
miss	1
lucy	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
aint	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
fixins	1
of	1
your	1
little	1
shoes	1
but	1
i	1
guess	1
if	1
you	1
wait	1
till	1
you	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
join	1
them	1
seven	1
young	1
women	1
with	1
the	1
lamps	1
when	1
you	1
quit	1
wont	1
you	1
just	1
hitch	1
up	1
alongside	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
road	1
together	1
driving	1
in	1
double	1
harness	1
well	1
he	1
did	1
look	1
so	1
goodhumoured	1
and	1
so	1
jolly	1
that	1
it	1
didnt	1
seem	1
half	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
refuse	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
poor	1
dr	1
seward	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
as	1
lightly	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
hitching	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
wasnt	1
broken	1
to	1
harness	1
at	1
all	1
yet	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
in	1
a	1
light	1
manner	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
on	1
so	1
grave	1
so	1
momentous	1
an	1
occasion	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
would	1
forgive	1
him	1
he	1
really	1
did	1
look	1
serious	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
couldnt	1
help	1
feeling	1
a	1
bit	1
serious	1
too	1
i	1
know	1
mina	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
horrid	1
flirt	1
though	1
i	1
couldnt	1
help	1
feeling	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
exultation	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
number	1
two	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
then	1
my	1
dear	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
began	1
pouring	1
out	1
a	1
perfect	1
torrent	1
of	1
lovemaking	1
laying	1
his	1
very	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
earnest	1
over	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
again	1
think	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
playful	1
always	1
and	1
never	1
earnest	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
merry	1
at	1
times	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
which	1
checked	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
manly	1
fervour	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
free	1
lucy	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
honesthearted	1
girl	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
here	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
you	1
clean	1
grit	1
right	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
your	1
soul	1
tell	1
me	1
like	1
one	1
good	1
fellow	1
to	1
another	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
that	1
you	1
care	1
for	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
ill	1
never	1
trouble	1
you	1
a	1
hairs	1
breadth	1
again	1
but	1
will	1
be	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
faithful	1
friend	1
my	1
dear	1
mina	1
why	1
are	1
men	1
so	1
noble	1
when	1
we	1
women	1
are	1
so	1
little	1
worthy	1
of	1
them	1
here	1
was	1
i	1
almost	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
this	1
greathearted	1
true	1
gentleman	1
i	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
this	1
a	1
very	1
sloppy	1
letter	1
in	1
more	1
ways	1
than	1
one	1
and	1
i	1
really	1
felt	1
very	1
badly	1
why	1
cant	1
they	1
let	1
a	1
girl	1
marry	1
three	1
men	1
or	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
want	1
her	1
and	1
save	1
all	1
this	1
trouble	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
heresy	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
though	1
i	1
was	1
crying	1
i	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
mr	1
morriss	1
brave	1
eyes	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
out	1
straight	1
yes	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
one	1
i	1
love	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
loves	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
right	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
frankly	1
for	1
quite	1
a	1
light	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
took	1
mine	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
hearty	1
way	1
thats	1
my	1
brave	1
girl	1
its	1
better	1
worth	1
being	1
late	1
for	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
winning	1
you	1
than	1
being	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
world	1

cry	1

for	1
me	1

and	1
pluck	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
friend	1

at	1
the	1

than	1

and	1
we	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
the	1
crescent	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
rooms	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
lovely	1
place	1
the	1
little	1
river	1
the	1
esk	1
runs	1
through	1
a	1
deep	1
valley	1
which	1
broadens	1
out	1
as	1
it	1
comes	1
near	1
the	1
harbour	1
a	1
great	1
viaduct	1
runs	1
across	1
with	1
high	1
piers	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
view	1
seems	1
somehow	1
further	1
away	1
than	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
the	1
valley	1
is	1
beautifully	1
green	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
steep	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
land	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
you	1
look	1
right	1
across	1
it	1
unless	1
you	1
are	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
down	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
town	1
the	1
side	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
are	1
all	1
redroofed	1
and	1
seem	1
piled	1
up	1
one	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
anyhow	1
like	1
the	1
pictures	1
we	1
see	1
of	1
nuremberg	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
town	1
is	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
whitby	1
abbey	1
which	1
was	1
sacked	1
by	1
the	1
danes	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
part	1
of	1
marmion	1
where	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
noble	1
ruin	1
of	1
immense	1
size	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
beautiful	1
and	1
romantic	1
bits	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
legend	1
that	1
a	1
white	1
lady	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
between	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
town	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
church	1
the	1
parish	1
one	1
round	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
graveyard	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
tombstones	1
this	1
is	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
the	1
nicest	1
spot	1
in	1
whitby	1
for	1
it	1
lies	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
and	1
all	1
up	1
the	1
bay	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
headland	1
called	1
kettleness	1
stretches	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
descends	1
so	1
steeply	1
over	1
the	1
harbour	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
has	1
fallen	1
away	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
graves	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stonework	1
of	1
the	1
graves	1
stretches	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
sandy	1
pathway	1
far	1
below	1
there	1
are	1
walks	1
with	1
seats	1
beside	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
churchyard	1
and	1
people	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
there	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
view	1
and	1
enjoying	1
the	1
breeze	1
i	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
here	1
very	1
often	1
myself	1
and	1
work	1
indeed	1
i	1
am	1
writing	1
now	1
with	1
my	1
book	1
on	1
my	1
knee	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
three	1
old	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
sitting	1
beside	1
me	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
all	1
day	1
but	1
sit	1
up	1
here	1
and	1
talk	1
the	1
harbour	1
lies	1
below	1
me	1
with	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
one	1
long	1
granite	1
wall	1
stretching	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
a	1
curve	1
outwards	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
lighthouse	1
a	1
heavy	1
seawall	1
runs	1
along	1
outside	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
near	1
side	1
the	1
seawall	1
makes	1
an	1
elbow	1
crooked	1
inversely	1
and	1
its	1
end	1
too	1
has	1
a	1
lighthouse	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
piers	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
narrow	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
harbour	1
which	1
then	1
suddenly	1
widens	1
it	1
is	1
nice	1
at	1
high	1
water	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
tide	1
is	1
out	1
it	1
shoals	1
away	1
to	1
nothing	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
merely	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
esk	1
running	1
between	1
banks	1
of	1
sand	1
with	1
rocks	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
outside	1
the	1
harbour	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
there	1
rises	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
a	1
great	1
reef	1
the	1
sharp	1
edge	1
of	1
which	1
runs	1
straight	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
south	1
lighthouse	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
buoy	1
with	1
a	1
bell	1
which	1
swings	1
in	1
bad	1
weather	1
and	1
sends	1
in	1
a	1
mournful	1
sound	1
on	1
the	1
wind	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
legend	1
here	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
ship	1
is	1
lost	1
bells	1
are	1
heard	1
out	1
at	1
sea	1
i	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
about	1
this	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
funny	1
old	1
man	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
awfully	1
old	1
for	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
all	1
gnarled	1
and	1
twisted	1
like	1
the	1
bark	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sailor	1
in	1
the	1
greenland	1
fishing	1
fleet	1
when	1
waterloo	1
was	1
fought	1
he	1
is	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
a	1
very	1
sceptical	1
person	1
for	1
when	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
bells	1
at	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
lady	1
at	1
the	1
abbey	1

said	1
very	1
brusquely	1
i	1

he	1

i	1
could	1

him	1
hurrying	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
down	1
the	1

the	1

are	1
a	1
great	1
feature	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
they	1
lead	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

there	1
are	1
hundreds	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
many	1
and	1
they	1
wind	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
delicate	1
curve	1
the	1
slope	1
is	1
so	1
gentle	1
that	1
a	1
horse	1
could	1
easily	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
them	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
must	1
originally	1
have	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
abbey	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1
home	1
too	1
lucy	1
went	1
out	1
visiting	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
duty	1
calls	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
home	1
by	1
this	1
1	1
august	1
i	1
came	1
up	1
here	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
with	1
lucy	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
talk	1
with	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
others	1
who	1
always	1
come	1
and	1
join	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
evidently	1
the	1
sir	1
oracle	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
a	1
most	1
dictatorial	1
person	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
anything	1
and	1
downfaces	1
everybody	1
if	1
he	1
cant	1
outargue	1
them	1
he	1
bullies	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
takes	1
their	1
silence	1
for	1
agreement	1
with	1
his	1
views	1
lucy	1
was	1
looking	1
sweetly	1
pretty	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
lawn	1
frock	1
she	1
has	1
got	1
a	1
beautiful	1
colour	1
since	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
any	1
time	1
in	1
coming	1
up	1
and	1
sitting	1
near	1
her	1
when	1
we	1
sat	1
down	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
sweet	1
with	1
old	1
people	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
all	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
even	1
my	1
old	1
man	1
succumbed	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
contradict	1
her	1
but	1
gave	1
me	1
double	1
share	1
instead	1
i	1
got	1
him	1
on	1
the	1

over	1
the	1
town	1
sometimes	1
in	1
rows	1
where	1
the	1
streets	1
are	1
and	1
sometimes	1
singly	1
they	1
run	1
right	1
up	1
the	1
esk	1
and	1
die	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
my	1

the	1

is	1
cut	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
black	1
line	1
of	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
house	1
next	1
the	1
abbey	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
lambs	1
are	1
bleating	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
away	1

there	1
is	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1
donkeys	1

up	1
the	1
paved	1
road	1
below	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
the	1
pier	1
is	1
playing	1
a	1
harsh	1
waltz	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
further	1
along	1
the	1

there	1
is	1
a	1
salvation	1
army	1
meeting	1
in	1
a	1
back	1
street	1
neither	1
of	1

hears	1
the	1

but	1
up	1
here	1
i	1
hear	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
both	1
i	1
wonder	1
where	1
jonathan	1
is	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
thinking	1
of	1
me	1

were	1

june	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
renfield	1
grows	1
more	1
interesting	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
get	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
has	1
certain	1
qualities	1
very	1
largely	1
developed	1
selfishness	1
secrecy	1
and	1
purpose	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
at	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
settled	1
scheme	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
but	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
his	1
redeeming	1
quality	1
is	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
animals	1
though	1
indeed	1
he	1
has	1
such	1
curious	1
turns	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
sometimes	1
imagine	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
abnormally	1
cruel	1
his	1
pets	1
are	1
of	1
odd	1
sorts	1
just	1
now	1
his	1
hobby	1
is	1
catching	1
flies	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
present	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
myself	1
to	1
expostulate	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
break	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
fury	1
as	1
i	1
expected	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
simple	1
seriousness	1
he	1
thought	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
may	1
i	1
have	1
three	1
days	1
i	1
shall	1
clear	1
them	1
away	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
would	1
do	1
i	1
must	1
watch	1
him	1
18	1
june	1
he	1
has	1
turned	1
his	1
mind	1
now	1
to	1
spiders	1
and	1
has	1
got	1
several	1
big	1
fellows	1
in	1
a	1
box	1
he	1
keeps	1
feeding	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
flies	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
becoming	1
sensibly	1
diminished	1
although	1
he	1
has	1
used	1
half	1
his	1
food	1
in	1
attracting	1
more	1
flies	1
from	1
outside	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
1	1
july	1
his	1
spiders	1
are	1
now	1
becoming	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
nuisance	1
as	1
his	1
flies	1
and	1
today	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
sad	1
at	1
this	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
clear	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
he	1
cheerfully	1
acquiesced	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
i	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
before	1
for	1
reduction	1
he	1
disgusted	1
me	1
much	1
while	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
when	1
a	1
horrid	1
blowfly	1
bloated	1
with	1
some	1
carrion	1
food	1
buzzed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
caught	1
it	1
held	1
it	1
exultantly	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
between	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb	1
and	1
before	1
i	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
i	1
scolded	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
argued	1
quietly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
very	1
wholesome	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
life	1
strong	1
life	1
and	1
gave	1
life	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
gave	1
me	1
an	1
idea	1
or	1
the	1
rudiment	1
of	1
one	1
i	1
must	1
watch	1
how	1
he	1
gets	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
spiders	1
he	1
has	1
evidently	1
some	1
deep	1
problem	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
for	1
he	1
keeps	1
a	1
little	1
notebook	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
jotting	1
down	1
something	1
whole	1
pages	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
masses	1
of	1
figures	1
generally	1
single	1
numbers	1
added	1
up	1
in	1
batches	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
totals	1
added	1
in	1
batches	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
focussing	1
some	1
account	1
as	1
the	1
auditors	1
put	1
it	1
8	1
july	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
method	1
in	1
his	1
madness	1
and	1
the	1
rudimentary	1
idea	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
growing	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
whole	1
idea	1
soon	1
and	1
then	1
oh	1
unconscious	1
cerebration	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
your	1
conscious	1
brother	1
i	1
kept	1
away	1
from	1
my	1
friend	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
notice	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
change	1
things	1
remain	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
parted	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
pets	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
he	1
has	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
sparrow	1
and	1
has	1
already	1
partially	1
tamed	1
it	1
his	1
means	1
of	1
taming	1
is	1
simple	1
for	1
already	1
the	1
spiders	1
have	1
diminished	1
those	1
that	1
do	1
remain	1
however	1
are	1
well	1
fed	1
for	1
he	1
still	1
brings	1
in	1
the	1
flies	1
by	1
tempting	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
food	1
19	1
july	1
we	1
are	1
progressing	1
my	1
friend	1
has	1
now	1
a	1
whole	1
colony	1
of	1
sparrows	1
and	1
his	1
flies	1
and	1
spiders	1
are	1
almost	1
obliterated	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
favour	1
a	1
very	1
very	1
great	1
favour	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
fawned	1
on	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
rapture	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
bearing	1
a	1
kitten	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
sleek	1
playful	1
kitten	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
play	1
with	1
and	1
teach	1
and	1
feed	1
and	1
feed	1
and	1
feed	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
unprepared	1
for	1
this	1
request	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
noticed	1
how	1
his	1
pets	1
went	1
on	1
increasing	1
in	1
size	1
and	1
vivacity	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
that	1
his	1
pretty	1
family	1
of	1
tame	1
sparrows	1
should	1
be	1
wiped	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
the	1
flies	1
and	1
the	1
spiders	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
would	1
see	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
rather	1
have	1
a	1
cat	1
than	1
a	1
kitten	1
his	1
eagerness	1
betrayed	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
oh	1
yes	1
i	1
would	1
like	1
a	1
cat	1
i	1
only	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
kitten	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
refuse	1
me	1
a	1
cat	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
refuse	1
me	1
a	1
kitten	1
would	1
they	1
i	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
feared	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
possible	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
see	1
about	1
it	1
his	1
face	1
fell	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
warning	1
of	1
danger	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sudden	1
fierce	1
sidelong	1
look	1
which	1
meant	1
killing	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
an	1
undeveloped	1
homicidal	1
maniac	1
i	1
shall	1
test	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
present	1
craving	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
work	1
out	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
know	1
more	1
10	1
pm	1
i	1
have	1
visited	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
brooding	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
implored	1
me	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
a	1
cat	1
that	1
his	1
salvation	1
depended	1
upon	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
firm	1
however	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
it	1
whereupon	1
he	1
went	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
gnawing	1
his	1
fingers	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
found	1
him	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
early	1
20	1
july	1
visited	1
renfield	1
very	1
early	1
before	1
the	1
attendant	1
went	1
his	1
rounds	1
found	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
humming	1
a	1
tune	1
he	1
was	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
sugar	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
was	1
manifestly	1
beginning	1
his	1
flycatching	1
again	1
and	1
beginning	1
it	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
grace	1
i	1
looked	1
around	1
for	1
his	1
birds	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
them	1
asked	1
him	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
he	1
replied	1
without	1
turning	1
round	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
flown	1
away	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
feathers	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
pillow	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
keeper	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
odd	1
about	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
11	1
am	1
the	1
attendant	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
renfield	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
sick	1
and	1
has	1
disgorged	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
of	1
feathers	1
my	1
belief	1
is	1
doctor	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
eaten	1
his	1
birds	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
just	1
took	1
and	1
ate	1
them	1
raw	1
11	1
pm	1
i	1
gave	1
renfield	1
a	1
strong	1
opiate	1
tonight	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
even	1
him	1
sleep	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
buzzing	1
about	1
my	1
brain	1
lately	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
the	1
theory	1
proved	1
my	1
homicidal	1
maniac	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
kind	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
invent	1
a	1
new	1
classification	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
call	1
him	1
a	1
zoophagous	1
lifeeating	1
maniac	1
what	1
he	1
desires	1
is	1
to	1
absorb	1
as	1
many	1
lives	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
laid	1
himself	1
out	1
to	1
achieve	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
cumulative	1
way	1
he	1
gave	1
many	1
flies	1
to	1
one	1
spider	1
and	1
many	1
spiders	1
to	1
one	1
bird	1
and	1
then	1
wanted	1
a	1
cat	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
many	1
birds	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
later	1
steps	1
it	1
would	1
almost	1
be	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
experiment	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
only	1

sneered	1
at	1

and	1
yet	1
look	1
at	1
its	1
results	1
today	1
why	1
not	1
advance	1

in	1
its	1
most	1
difficult	1
and	1

aspect	1

the	1

to	1
the	1

of	1
even	1

i	1
am	1
anxious	1
and	1
it	1
soothes	1
me	1
to	1
express	1
myself	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
whispering	1
to	1
ones	1
self	1
and	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1

time	1

there	1
is	1
also	1
something	1
about	1
the	1

that	1
makes	1
it	1
different	1
from	1

i	1
am	1
unhappy	1
about	1
lucy	1
and	1
about	1
jonathan	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
from	1
jonathan	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
concerned	1
but	1
yesterday	1
dear	1
mr	1
hawkins	1
who	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
kind	1
sent	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
written	1
asking	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
enclosed	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
received	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
line	1
dated	1
from	1
castle	1
dracula	1
and	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
starting	1
for	1
home	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
jonathan	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
uneasy	1
then	1
too	1
lucy	1
although	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
has	1
lately	1
taken	1
to	1
her	1
old	1
habit	1
of	1
walking	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
her	1
mother	1
has	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
about	1

to	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
our	1
room	1
every	1
night	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
has	1
got	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
sleepwalkers	1
always	1
go	1
out	1
on	1
roofs	1
of	1
houses	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
cliffs	1
and	1
then	1
get	1
suddenly	1
wakened	1
and	1
fall	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
despairing	1
cry	1
that	1
echoes	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
poor	1
dear	1
she	1
is	1
naturally	1
anxious	1
about	1
lucy	1
and	1
she	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
lucys	1
father	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
habit	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
dress	1
himself	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
stopped	1
lucy	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
already	1
planning	1
out	1
her	1
dresses	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
house	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
arranged	1
i	1
sympathise	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
i	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
only	1
jonathan	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
start	1
in	1
life	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
way	1

the	1
moments	1

and	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1

i	1
daresay	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
waiting	1

still	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
perpetually	1

oh	1
i	1
do	1
hope	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
ill	1
he	1
surely	1

have	1
written	1
i	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
last	1

me	1
it	1

not	1
read	1

yet	1
it	1

walked	1
much	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
the	1

i	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
even	1
in	1
her	1

she	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
watching	1
me	1

where	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
or	1
where	1
to	1

that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
storm	1

the	1
weather	1

today	1

was	1
a	1
dead	1
calm	1
a	1
sultry	1
heat	1
and	1
that	1
prevailing	1
intensity	1
which	1
on	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
thunder	1
affects	1
persons	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
nature	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
lights	1
in	1
sight	1
at	1
sea	1
for	1
even	1
the	1
coasting	1
steamers	1
which	1
usually	1
hug	1
the	1

so	1
closely	1
kept	1
well	1
to	1

and	1
but	1
few	1
fishingboats	1
were	1
in	1
sight	1
the	1
only	1
sail	1
noticeable	1
was	1
a	1
foreign	1
schooner	1
with	1
all	1
sails	1
set	1
which	1
was	1
seemingly	1
going	1
westwards	1
the	1
foolhardiness	1
or	1
ignorance	1
of	1
her	1
officers	1
was	1
a	1
prolific	1
theme	1
for	1
comment	1
whilst	1
she	1
remained	1
in	1
sight	1
and	1
efforts	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
signal	1
her	1
to	1
reduce	1
sail	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
danger	1
before	1
the	1
night	1
shut	1
down	1
she	1
was	1
seen	1
with	1
sails	1
idly	1
napping	1
as	1
she	1
gently	1
rolled	1
on	1
the	1
undulating	1
swell	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
idle	1
as	1
a	1
painted	1
ship	1
upon	1
a	1
painted	1
ocean	1
shortly	1
before	1
ten	1
oclock	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
grew	1
quite	1
oppressive	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
was	1
so	1
marked	1
that	1
the	1
bleating	1
of	1
a	1
sheep	1
inland	1
or	1
the	1
barking	1
of	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
was	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
and	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
the	1
pier	1
with	1
its	1
lively	1
french	1
air	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
discord	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
harmony	1
of	1
natures	1
silence	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
midnight	1
came	1
a	1
strange	1
sound	1
from	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
high	1
overhead	1
the	1
air	1
began	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
strange	1
faint	1
hollow	1
booming	1
then	1
without	1
warning	1
the	1
tempest	1
broke	1
with	1
a	1
rapidity	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
incredible	1
and	1
even	1
afterwards	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
whole	1
aspect	1
of	1
nature	1
at	1
once	1
became	1
convulsed	1
the	1
waves	1
rose	1
in	1
growing	1
fury	1
each	1
overtopping	1
its	1
fellow	1
till	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
lately	1
glassy	1
sea	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
roaring	1
and	1
devouring	1
monster	1
whitecrested	1
waves	1
beat	1
madly	1
on	1
the	1
level	1
sands	1
and	1
rushed	1
up	1
the	1
shelving	1
cliffs	1
others	1
broke	1
over	1
the	1
piers	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
spume	1
swept	1
the	1
lanthorns	1
of	1
the	1
lighthouses	1
which	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
either	1
pier	1
of	1
whitby	1
harbour	1
the	1
wind	1
roared	1
like	1
thunder	1
and	1
blew	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
even	1
strong	1
men	1
kept	1
their	1
feet	1
or	1
clung	1
with	1
grim	1
clasp	1
to	1
the	1
iron	1
stanchions	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
necessary	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
entire	1
piers	1
from	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
onlookers	1
or	1
else	1
the	1
fatalities	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
increased	1
manifold	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
difficulties	1
and	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
masses	1
of	1
seafog	1
came	1
drifting	1
inland	1
white	1
wet	1
clouds	1
which	1
swept	1
by	1
in	1
ghostly	1
fashion	1
so	1
dank	1
and	1
damp	1
and	1
cold	1
that	1
it	1
needed	1
but	1
little	1
effort	1
of	1
imagination	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
those	1
lost	1
at	1
sea	1
were	1
touching	1
their	1
living	1
brethren	1
with	1
the	1
clammy	1
hands	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
shuddered	1
as	1
the	1
wreaths	1
of	1
seamist	1
swept	1
by	1
at	1
times	1
the	1
mist	1
cleared	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
some	1
distance	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
lightning	1
which	1
now	1
came	1
thick	1
and	1
fast	1
followed	1
by	1
such	1
sudden	1
peals	1
of	1
thunder	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
sky	1
overhead	1
seemed	1
trembling	1
under	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
scenes	1
thus	1
revealed	1
were	1
of	1
immeasurable	1
grandeur	1
and	1
of	1
absorbing	1
interest	1
the	1
sea	1
running	1
mountains	1
high	1
threw	1
skywards	1
with	1
each	1
wave	1
mighty	1
masses	1
of	1
white	1
foam	1
which	1
the	1
tempest	1
seemed	1
to	1
snatch	1
at	1
and	1
whirl	1
away	1
into	1
space	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
fishingboat	1
with	1
a	1
rag	1
of	1
sail	1
running	1
madly	1
for	1
shelter	1
before	1
the	1
blast	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
white	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
stormtossed	1
seabird	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
the	1
new	1
searchlight	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
experiment	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
tried	1
the	1
officers	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
it	1
got	1
it	1
into	1
working	1
order	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
pauses	1
of	1
the	1
inrushing	1
mist	1
swept	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
its	1
service	1
was	1
most	1
effective	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
fishingboat	1
with	1
gunwale	1
under	1
water	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
harbour	1
able	1
by	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
the	1
sheltering	1
light	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
dashing	1
against	1
the	1
piers	1
as	1
each	1
boat	1
achieved	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
port	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
joy	1
from	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
people	1
on	1
shore	1
a	1
shout	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
seemed	1
to	1
cleave	1
the	1
gale	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
swept	1
away	1
in	1
its	1
rush	1
before	1
long	1
the	1
searchlight	1
discovered	1
some	1
distance	1
away	1
a	1
schooner	1
with	1
all	1
sails	1
set	1
apparently	1
the	1
same	1
vessel	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
noticed	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
backed	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shudder	1
amongst	1
the	1
watchers	1
on	1
the	1
cliff	1
as	1
they	1
realised	1
the	1
terrible	1
danger	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
now	1
was	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
port	1
lay	1
the	1
great	1
flat	1
reef	1
on	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
good	1
ships	1
have	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
suffered	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
blowing	1
from	1
its	1
present	1
quarter	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
impossible	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
fetch	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
high	1
tide	1
but	1
the	1
waves	1
were	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
in	1
their	1
troughs	1
the	1
shallows	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
were	1
almost	1
visible	1
and	1
the	1
schooner	1
with	1
all	1
sails	1
set	1
was	1
rushing	1
with	1
such	1
speed	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
one	1
old	1
salt	1
she	1
must	1
fetch	1
up	1
somewhere	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
hell	1
then	1
came	1
another	1
rush	1
of	1
seafog	1
greater	1
than	1
any	1
hitherto	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
dank	1
mist	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
close	1
on	1
all	1
things	1
like	1
a	1
grey	1
pall	1
and	1
left	1
available	1
to	1
men	1
only	1
the	1
organ	1
of	1
hearing	1
for	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
tempest	1
and	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
booming	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
billows	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
damp	1
oblivion	1
even	1
louder	1
than	1
before	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
searchlight	1
were	1
kept	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
harbour	1
mouth	1
across	1
the	1
east	1
pier	1
where	1
the	1
shock	1
was	1
expected	1
and	1
men	1
waited	1
breathless	1
the	1
wind	1
suddenly	1
shifted	1
to	1
the	1
northeast	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seafog	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
blast	1
and	1
then	1
mirabile	1
dictu	1
between	1
the	1
piers	1
leaping	1
from	1
wave	1
to	1
wave	1
as	1
it	1
rushed	1
at	1
headlong	1
speed	1
swept	1
the	1
strange	1
schooner	1
before	1
the	1
blast	1
with	1
all	1
sail	1
set	1
and	1
gained	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
the	1
searchlight	1
followed	1
her	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
through	1
all	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
for	1
lashed	1
to	1
the	1
helm	1
was	1
a	1
corpse	1
with	1
drooping	1
head	1
which	1
swung	1
horribly	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
at	1
each	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
no	1
other	1
form	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
deck	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
great	1
awe	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
as	1
they	1
realised	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
a	1
miracle	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
harbour	1
unsteered	1
save	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
however	1
all	1
took	1
place	1
more	1
quickly	1
than	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
write	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
schooner	1
paused	1
not	1
but	1
rushing	1
across	1
the	1
harbour	1
pitched	1
herself	1
on	1
that	1
accumulation	1
of	1
sand	1
and	1
gravel	1
washed	1
by	1
many	1
tides	1
and	1
many	1
storms	1
into	1
the	1
southeast	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
pier	1
jutting	1
under	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
known	1
locally	1
as	1
tate	1
hill	1
pier	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
a	1
considerable	1
concussion	1
as	1
the	1
vessel	1
drove	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sand	1
heap	1
every	1
spar	1
rope	1
and	1
stay	1
was	1
strained	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
tophammer	1
came	1
crashing	1
down	1
but	1
strangest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
the	1
shore	1
was	1
touched	1
an	1
immense	1
dog	1
sprang	1
up	1
on	1
deck	1
from	1
below	1
as	1
if	1
shot	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
concussion	1
and	1
running	1
forward	1
jumped	1
from	1
the	1
bow	1
on	1
the	1
sand	1
making	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
steep	1
cliff	1
where	1
the	1
churchyard	1
hangs	1
over	1
the	1
laneway	1
to	1
the	1
east	1

steeply	1
that	1

them	1

project	1
over	1
where	1
the	1
sustaining	1
cliff	1
has	1
fallen	1
away	1
it	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
which	1
seemed	1
intensified	1
just	1
beyond	1
the	1
focus	1
of	1
the	1
searchlight	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
on	1
tate	1
hill	1
pier	1
as	1
all	1
those	1
whose	1
houses	1
are	1
in	1

either	1
in	1

out	1

the	1
coastguard	1
on	1
duty	1
on	1
the	1
eastern	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
ran	1
down	1

the	1
first	1
to	1
climb	1
on	1

working	1
the	1

after	1
scouring	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
without	1

anything	1
then	1
turned	1
the	1

at	1

under	1
some	1
sudden	1
emotion	1
this	1

to	1
pique	1

quite	1
a	1

your	1

is	1
a	1
fairly	1
good	1

came	1
well	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
however	1
i	1
found	1
already	1
assembled	1
on	1
the	1
pier	1
a	1
crowd	1
whom	1
the	1
coastguard	1

refused	1
to	1
allow	1
to	1
come	1
on	1

was	1
as	1
your	1

permitted	1
to	1
climb	1
on	1

was	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
group	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
dead	1
seaman	1
whilst	1
actually	1
lashed	1
to	1
the	1
wheel	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
coastguard	1
was	1
surprised	1
or	1
even	1
awed	1
for	1
not	1
often	1
can	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
have	1

the	1

simply	1
fastened	1
by	1

over	1

the	1

around	1

and	1
all	1
kept	1
fast	1
by	1
the	1

the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
seated	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
but	1
the	1
flapping	1
and	1
buffeting	1
of	1
the	1
sails	1
had	1
worked	1
through	1
the	1
rudder	1
of	1
the	1
wheel	1
and	1
dragged	1
him	1
to	1

fro	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
cords	1
with	1
which	1

who	1
came	1
immediately	1

declared	1
after	1

examination	1
that	1
the	1

dead	1
for	1
quite	1
two	1
days	1

carefully	1
corked	1
empty	1

for	1
a	1
little	1
roll	1

proved	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
addendum	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

said	1
the	1
man	1
must	1

up	1
his	1
own	1

fastening	1

the	1

are	1
wagging	1

one	1
young	1

of	1
the	1

almost	1
more	1
startling	1
than	1
the	1
thing	1
itself	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
schooner	1
is	1
a	1
russian	1
from	1
varna	1
and	1
is	1
called	1

almost	1
entirely	1

the	1

coincidence	1
the	1
officials	1
of	1
the	1

have	1
been	1
most	1

it	1

it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
disappeared	1
entirely	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
frightened	1

made	1
its	1
way	1
on	1
to	1
the	1

it	1
is	1
still	1

was	1

as	1

of	1

the	1

however	1
is	1
with	1

cautiously	1

when	1

got	1
to	1

found	1
no	1

the	1

all	1
closed	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1

i	1
am	1
afraid	1
the	1
panic	1
may	1
spread	1
to	1
allay	1
it	1
i	1
shall	1
today	1
search	1
entire	1
ship	1
carefully	1
from	1
stem	1
to	1

later	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
got	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
crew	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
evidently	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
we	1
would	1
search	1
from	1
stem	1
to	1
stern	1
first	1
mate	1
angry	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
folly	1
and	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
such	1
foolish	1
ideas	1
would	1
demoralise	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
engage	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
trouble	1
with	1
a	1
handspike	1
i	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
helm	1
while	1
the	1
rest	1
began	1
thorough	1
search	1
all	1
keeping	1
abreast	1
with	1
lanterns	1
we	1
left	1
no	1

there	1

only	1
the	1

august	1
at	1
midnight	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
wheel	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
it	1
found	1
no	1
one	1
there	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
steady	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
ran	1
before	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
yawing	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
leave	1
it	1
so	1
shouted	1
for	1
the	1
mate	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
rushed	1
up	1
on	1
deck	1
in	1
his	1
flannels	1
he	1
looked	1
wildeyed	1
and	1
haggard	1
and	1
i	1
greatly	1
fear	1
his	1
reason	1
has	1
given	1
way	1
he	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
whispered	1
hoarsely	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
as	1
though	1
fearing	1
the	1
very	1
air	1
might	1
hear	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
last	1
night	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
tall	1
and	1
thin	1
and	1
ghastly	1
pale	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
i	1
crept	1
behind	1
it	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
my	1
knife	1
but	1
the	1
knife	1
went	1
through	1
it	1
empty	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
knife	1
and	1
drove	1
it	1
savagely	1
into	1
space	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
ill	1
find	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
perhaps	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
boxes	1
ill	1
unscrew	1
them	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
work	1
the	1
helm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
warning	1
look	1
and	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lip	1
he	1
went	1
below	1
there	1
was	1
springing	1
up	1
a	1
choppy	1
wind	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
helm	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
on	1
deck	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
toolchest	1
and	1
a	1
lantern	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
forward	1
hatchway	1
he	1
is	1
mad	1
stark	1
raving	1
mad	1
and	1
its	1
no	1
use	1
my	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
he	1
cant	1
hurt	1
those	1
big	1
boxes	1
they	1
are	1
invoiced	1
as	1
clay	1
and	1
to	1
pull	1
them	1
about	1
is	1
as	1
harmless	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
so	1
here	1
i	1
stay	1
and	1
mind	1
the	1
helm	1
and	1
write	1
these	1
notes	1
i	1
can	1
only	1
trust	1
in	1
god	1
and	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
fog	1
clears	1
then	1
if	1
i	1
cant	1
steer	1
to	1
any	1
harbour	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
is	1
i	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
sails	1
and	1
lie	1
by	1
and	1
signal	1
for	1
help	1
it	1
is	1
nearly	1
all	1
over	1
now	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
mate	1
would	1
come	1
out	1
calmer	1
for	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
knocking	1
away	1
at	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
and	1
work	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
hatchway	1
a	1
sudden	1
startled	1
scream	1
which	1
made	1
my	1
blood	1
run	1
cold	1
and	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
came	1
as	1
if	1
shot	1
from	1
a	1
gun	1
a	1
raging	1
madman	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolling	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
convulsed	1
with	1
fear	1
save	1
me	1
save	1
me	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
round	1
on	1
the	1
blanket	1
of	1
fog	1
his	1
horror	1
turned	1
to	1
despair	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
steady	1
voice	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
come	1
too	1
captain	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
he	1
is	1
there	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
secret	1
now	1
the	1
sea	1
will	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
move	1
forward	1
to	1
seize	1
him	1
he	1
sprang	1
on	1
the	1
bulwark	1
and	1
deliberately	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
secret	1
too	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
madman	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
followed	1
them	1
himself	1
god	1
help	1
me	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
horrors	1
when	1
i	1
get	1
to	1
port	1
when	1
i	1
get	1
to	1

that	1
ever	1
be	1
4	1
august	1
still	1
fog	1
which	1
the	1
sunrise	1
cannot	1
pierce	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
sunrise	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
sailor	1
why	1
else	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
go	1
below	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
helm	1
so	1
here	1
all	1
night	1
i	1
stayed	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
dimness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
him	1
god	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
right	1
to	1
jump	1
overboard	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
sailor	1
in	1

no	1
man	1
can	1
object	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
captain	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
ship	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1
baffle	1
this	1
fiend	1

monster	1
for	1
i	1
shall	1
tie	1
my	1

lucy	1
was	1
very	1
restless	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
i	1
too	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
the	1
storm	1
was	1
fearful	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
boomed	1
loudly	1
among	1
the	1
chimneypots	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
when	1
a	1
sharp	1
puff	1
came	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
distant	1
gun	1
strangely	1
enough	1
lucy	1
did	1
not	1
wake	1
but	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
twice	1
and	1
dressed	1
herself	1
fortunately	1
each	1
time	1
i	1
awoke	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
managed	1
to	1
undress	1
her	1
without	1
waking	1
her	1
and	1
got	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
bed	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
thing	1
this	1
sleepwalking	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
her	1
will	1
is	1
thwarted	1

physical	1
way	1
her	1
intention	1

there	1

any	1
disappears	1
and	1
she	1
yields	1
herself	1
almost	1
exactly	1
to	1
the	1
routine	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
we	1
both	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
harbour	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
anything	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
few	1
people	1
about	1

though	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
clear	1
and	1
fresh	1
the	1
big	1
grimlooking	1
waves	1
that	1
seemed	1
dark	1
themselves	1
because	1
the	1
foam	1
that	1
topped	1
them	1
was	1
like	1
snow	1
forced	1
themselves	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
narrow	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
like	1
a	1
bullying	1
man	1
going	1
through	1
a	1
crowd	1
somehow	1
i	1
felt	1
glad	1
that	1
jonathan	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
last	1
night	1
but	1
on	1
land	1
but	1
oh	1
is	1
he	1
on	1
land	1
or	1
sea	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
and	1
how	1
i	1
am	1
getting	1
fearfully	1
anxious	1
about	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
anything	1

of	1

today	1
was	1
most	1
touching	1
every	1
boat	1
in	1
the	1
harbour	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
captains	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
tate	1
hill	1
pier	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
churchyard	1
lucy	1
came	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
early	1
to	1
our	1
old	1
seat	1
whilst	1
the	1
cortege	1
of	1
boats	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
the	1
viaduct	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
lovely	1
view	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
procession	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
was	1
laid	1
to	1
rest	1
quite	1
near	1
our	1
seat	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
stood	1
on	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
and	1
saw	1
everything	1
poor	1
lucy	1
seemed	1
much	1
upset	1
she	1
was	1
restless	1
and	1
uneasy	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
think	1
that	1
her	1
dreaming	1
at	1
night	1
is	1
telling	1
on	1
her	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
odd	1
in	1
one	1
thing	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
cause	1
for	1
restlessness	1
or	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
herself	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
additional	1
cause	1
in	1
that	1
poor	1
old	1
mr	1
swales	1
was	1
found	1
dead	1
this	1
morning	1
on	1
our	1
seat	1
his	1
neck	1
being	1
broken	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
as	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
fallen	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
seat	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
fright	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
horror	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
made	1
them	1
shudder	1
poor	1
dear	1
old	1
man	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
death	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
eyes	1
lucy	1
is	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
sensitive	1
that	1
she	1
feels	1
influences	1
more	1
acutely	1
than	1
other	1
people	1
do	1
just	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
upset	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
thing	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
heed	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
myself	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
animals	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
here	1
often	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
boats	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
dog	1
the	1
dog	1
is	1
always	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
quiet	1
persons	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
man	1
angry	1
nor	1
heard	1
the	1
dog	1
bark	1
during	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
dog	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
its	1
master	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
with	1
us	1
but	1
kept	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
off	1
barking	1
and	1
howling	1
its	1
master	1
spoke	1
to	1
it	1
gently	1
and	1
then	1
harshly	1
and	1
then	1
angrily	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
neither	1
come	1
nor	1
cease	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fury	1
with	1
its	1
eyes	1
savage	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
hairs	1
bristling	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
cats	1
tail	1
when	1
puss	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
warpath	1
finally	1
the	1
man	1
too	1
got	1
angry	1
and	1
jumped	1
down	1
and	1
kicked	1
the	1
dog	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
scruff	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
half	1
dragged	1
and	1
half	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
tombstone	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
seat	1
is	1
fixed	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
touched	1
the	1
stone	1
the	1
poor	1
thing	1
became	1
quiet	1
and	1
fell	1
all	1
into	1
a	1
tremble	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
but	1
crouched	1
down	1
quivering	1
and	1
cowering	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
pitiable	1
state	1
of	1
terror	1
that	1
i	1
tried	1
though	1
without	1
effect	1
to	1
comfort	1
it	1
lucy	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
pity	1
too	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
dog	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
agonised	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
i	1
greatly	1
fear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
of	1
too	1
supersensitive	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
without	1
trouble	1
she	1
will	1
be	1

her	1
to	1

by	1
the	1

to	1

towards	1
us	1
in	1

frightened	1
the	1

out	1
of	1
us	1
i	1
believe	1
we	1
forgot	1
everything	1

of	1

it	1
seemed	1
to	1

give	1
us	1
a	1
fresh	1

a	1
hard	1
fight	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
heroic	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
some	1
day	1
the	1
bishops	1
must	1
get	1
together	1
and	1
see	1
about	1
breeding	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
class	1
of	1
curates	1
who	1
dont	1
take	1
supper	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
pressed	1
to	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
know	1
when	1
girls	1
are	1
tired	1
lucy	1
is	1
asleep	1
and	1
breathing	1
softly	1
she	1
has	1
more	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
looks	1
oh	1
so	1
sweet	1
if	1
mr	1
holmwood	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
drawingroom	1
i	1
wonder	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
now	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
women	1
writers	1
will	1
some	1
day	1
start	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
asleep	1
before	1
proposing	1
or	1
accepting	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
the	1
new	1
woman	1
wont	1
condescend	1
in	1
future	1
to	1
accept	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
proposing	1
herself	1
and	1
a	1
nice	1
job	1
she	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
too	1
theres	1
some	1
consolation	1
in	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
tonight	1
because	1
dear	1
lucy	1
seems	1
better	1
i	1
really	1
believe	1
she	1
has	1
turned	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
over	1
her	1
troubles	1
with	1
dreaming	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
quite	1
happy	1
if	1
i	1
only	1
knew	1
if	1
jonathan	1
god	1
bless	1
and	1
keep	1

again	1
no	1
sleep	1
now	1
so	1
i	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
write	1
i	1
am	1
too	1
agitated	1
to	1
sleep	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
adventure	1
such	1
an	1
agonising	1
experience	1
i	1
fell	1
asleep	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
closed	1
my	1
diary	1
suddenly	1
i	1
became	1
broad	1
awake	1
and	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
sense	1
of	1
fear	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
feeling	1
of	1
emptiness	1
around	1
me	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
dark	1
so	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
lucys	1
bed	1
i	1
stole	1
across	1
and	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
empty	1
i	1
lit	1
a	1
match	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
but	1
not	1
locked	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
wake	1
her	1
mother	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
ill	1
lately	1
so	1
threw	1
on	1
some	1
clothes	1
and	1
got	1
ready	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
clothes	1
she	1
wore	1
might	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
clue	1
to	1
her	1
dreaming	1
intention	1
dressinggown	1
would	1
mean	1
house	1
dress	1
outside	1
dressinggown	1
and	1
dress	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
thank	1
god	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
myself	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
nightdress	1
i	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
sittingroom	1
not	1
there	1
then	1
i	1
looked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
open	1
rooms	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
an	1
evergrowing	1
fear	1
chilling	1
my	1
heart	1
finally	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
halldoor	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
open	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
wide	1
open	1
but	1
the	1
catch	1
of	1
the	1
lock	1
had	1
not	1
caught	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
are	1
careful	1
to	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
every	1
night	1
so	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
lucy	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
happen	1
a	1
vague	1
overmastering	1
fear	1
obscured	1
all	1
details	1
i	1
took	1
a	1
big	1
heavy	1
shawl	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
the	1
clock	1
was	1
striking	1
one	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
crescent	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
sight	1
i	1
ran	1
along	1
the	1
north	1
terrace	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
which	1
i	1
expected	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
cliff	1
above	1
the	1
pier	1
i	1
looked	1
across	1
the	1
harbour	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
or	1
fear	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
which	1
of	1
seeing	1
lucy	1
in	1
our	1
favourite	1
seat	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
full	1
moon	1
with	1
heavy	1
black	1
driving	1
clouds	1
which	1
threw	1
the	1
whole	1
scene	1
into	1
a	1
fleeting	1
diorama	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
shade	1
as	1
they	1
sailed	1
across	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
as	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
cloud	1
obscured	1
st	1
marys	1
church	1
and	1
all	1
around	1
it	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
cloud	1
passed	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
abbey	1
coming	1
into	1
view	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
narrow	1
band	1
of	1
light	1
as	1
sharp	1
as	1
a	1
swordcut	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
the	1
churchyard	1
became	1
gradually	1
visible	1
whatever	1
my	1
expectation	1
was	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
disappointed	1
for	1
there	1
on	1
our	1
favourite	1
seat	1
the	1
silver	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
struck	1
a	1
halfreclining	1
figure	1
snowy	1
white	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
too	1
quick	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
much	1
for	1
shadow	1
shut	1
down	1
on	1
light	1
almost	1
immediately	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
though	1
something	1
dark	1
stood	1
behind	1
the	1
seat	1
where	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
shone	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
whether	1
man	1
or	1
beast	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
catch	1
another	1
glance	1
but	1
flew	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
pier	1
and	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
fishmarket	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
the	1
town	1
seemed	1
as	1
dead	1
for	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
did	1
i	1
see	1
i	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
for	1
i	1
wanted	1
no	1
witness	1
of	1
poor	1
lucys	1
condition	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
distance	1
seemed	1
endless	1
and	1
my	1
knees	1
trembled	1
and	1
my	1
breath	1
came	1
laboured	1
as	1
i	1
toiled	1
up	1
the	1
endless	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
abbey	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
fast	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
my	1
feet	1
were	1
weighted	1
with	1
lead	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
every	1
joint	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
were	1
rusty	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
close	1
enough	1
to	1
distinguish	1
it	1
even	1
through	1
the	1
spells	1
of	1
shadow	1
there	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
something	1
long	1
and	1
black	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
halfreclining	1
white	1
figure	1
i	1
called	1
in	1
fright	1
lucy	1
lucy	1
and	1
something	1
raised	1
a	1
head	1
and	1
from	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
red	1
gleaming	1
eyes	1
lucy	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
i	1
ran	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
as	1
i	1
entered	1
the	1
church	1
was	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
so	1
i	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
view	1
again	1
the	1
cloud	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
moonlight	1
struck	1
so	1
brilliantly	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
lucy	1
half	1
reclining	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
lying	1
over	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
seat	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
alone	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
living	1
thing	1
about	1
when	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
asleep	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
parted	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
breathing	1
not	1
softly	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
in	1
long	1
heavy	1
gasps	1
as	1
though	1
striving	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
lungs	1
full	1
at	1
every	1
breath	1
as	1
i	1
came	1
close	1
she	1
put	1
up	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
and	1
pulled	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
her	1
nightdress	1
close	1
around	1
her	1
throat	1
whilst	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
shudder	1
through	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
cold	1
i	1
flung	1
the	1
warm	1
shawl	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
edges	1
tight	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
for	1
i	1
dreaded	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
get	1
some	1
deadly	1
chill	1
from	1
the	1
night	1
air	1
unclad	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
wake	1
her	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
my	1
hands	1
free	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
help	1
her	1
i	1
fastened	1
the	1
shawl	1
at	1
her	1
throat	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
safetypin	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
clumsy	1
in	1
my	1
anxiety	1
and	1
pinched	1
or	1
pricked	1
her	1
with	1
it	1
for	1
byandby	1
when	1
her	1
breathing	1
became	1
quieter	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
throat	1
again	1
and	1
moaned	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
her	1
carefully	1
wrapped	1
up	1
i	1
put	1
my	1
shoes	1
on	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
very	1
gently	1
to	1
wake	1
her	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
but	1
gradually	1
she	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
uneasy	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
moaning	1
and	1
sighing	1
occasionally	1
at	1
last	1
as	1
time	1
was	1
passing	1
fast	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
other	1
reasons	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
home	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
shook	1
her	1
more	1
forcibly	1
till	1
finally	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
awoke	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
as	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realise	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
lucy	1
always	1
wakes	1
prettily	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
her	1
body	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
chilled	1
with	1
cold	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
somewhat	1
appalled	1
at	1
waking	1
unclad	1
in	1
a	1
churchyard	1
at	1
night	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
her	1
grace	1
she	1
trembled	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
me	1
home	1
she	1
rose	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
as	1
we	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
gravel	1
hurt	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
lucy	1
noticed	1
me	1
wince	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
my	1
taking	1
my	1
shoes	1
but	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
however	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
pathway	1
outside	1
the	1
churchyard	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
puddle	1
of	1
water	1
remaining	1
from	1
the	1
storm	1
i	1
daubed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
mud	1
using	1
each	1
foot	1
in	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
so	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
home	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
case	1
we	1
should	1
meet	1
any	1
one	1
should	1
notice	1
my	1
bare	1
feet	1
fortune	1
favoured	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
got	1
home	1
without	1
meeting	1
a	1
soul	1
once	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
seemed	1
not	1
quite	1
sober	1
passing	1
along	1
a	1
street	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us	1
but	1
we	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
door	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared	1
up	1
an	1
opening	1
such	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
here	1
steep	1
little	1
closes	1
or	1
wynds	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
in	1
scotland	1
my	1
heart	1
beat	1
so	1
loud	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
sometimes	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
should	1
faint	1
i	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
anxiety	1
about	1
lucy	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
her	1
health	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
exposure	1
but	1
for	1
her	1
reputation	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
story	1
should	1
get	1
wind	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
in	1
and	1
had	1
washed	1
our	1
feet	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
a	1
prayer	1
of	1
thankfulness	1
together	1
i	1
tucked	1
her	1
into	1
bed	1
before	1
falling	1
asleep	1
she	1
asked	1
even	1
implored	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
even	1
her	1
mother	1
about	1
her	1
sleepwalking	1
adventure	1
i	1
hesitated	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
promise	1
but	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
mothers	1
health	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
would	1
fret	1
her	1
and	1
thinking	1
too	1
of	1
how	1
such	1
a	1
story	1
might	1
become	1
distorted	1
may	1
infallibly	1
would	1
in	1
case	1
it	1
should	1
leak	1
out	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
wiser	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
did	1
right	1
i	1
have	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
is	1
tied	1
to	1
my	1
wrist	1
so	1
perhaps	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
again	1
disturbed	1
lucy	1
is	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
the	1
reflex	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
is	1
high	1
and	1
far	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
same	1
day	1
noon	1
all	1
goes	1
well	1
lucy	1
slept	1
till	1
i	1
woke	1
her	1
and	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
even	1
changed	1
her	1
side	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
harmed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
has	1
benefited	1
her	1
for	1
she	1
looks	1
better	1
this	1
morning	1
than	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
weeks	1
i	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
my	1
clumsiness	1
with	1
the	1
safetypin	1
hurt	1
her	1
indeed	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
serious	1
for	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
her	1
throat	1
was	1
pierced	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
pinched	1
up	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
loose	1
skin	1
and	1
have	1
transfixed	1
it	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
little	1
red	1
points	1
like	1
pinpricks	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
her	1
nightdress	1
was	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
when	1
i	1
apologised	1
and	1
was	1
concerned	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
laughed	1
and	1
petted	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
feel	1
it	1
fortunately	1
it	1
cannot	1
leave	1
a	1
scar	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
tiny	1
same	1
day	1
night	1
we	1
passed	1
a	1
happy	1
day	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
bright	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cool	1
breeze	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
lunch	1
to	1
mulgrave	1
woods	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
driving	1
by	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
lucy	1
and	1
i	1
walking	1
by	1
the	1
cliffpath	1
and	1
joining	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
sad	1
myself	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
how	1
absolutely	1
happy	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
had	1
jonathan	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
there	1
i	1
must	1
only	1
be	1
patient	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
we	1
strolled	1
in	1
the	1
casino	1
terrace	1
and	1
heard	1
some	1
good	1
music	1
by	1
spohr	1
and	1
mackenzie	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
early	1
lucy	1
seems	1
more	1
restful	1
than	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
shall	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
secure	1
the	1
key	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
before	1
though	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
expect	1
any	1
trouble	1
tonight	1
12	1
august	1
my	1
expectations	1
were	1
wrong	1
for	1
twice	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
was	1
wakened	1
by	1
lucy	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
she	1
seemed	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
impatient	1
at	1
finding	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
bed	1
under	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
protest	1
i	1
woke	1
with	1
the	1
dawn	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
birds	1
chirping	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
lucy	1
woke	1
too	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
was	1
even	1
better	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
morning	1
all	1
her	1
old	1
gaiety	1
of	1
manner	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
and	1
snuggled	1
in	1
beside	1
me	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
arthur	1
i	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
anxious	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
jonathan	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
me	1
well	1
she	1
succeeded	1
somewhat	1
for	1
though	1
sympathy	1
cant	1
alter	1
facts	1
it	1
can	1
help	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
more	1
bearable	1
13	1
august	1
another	1
quiet	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
key	1
on	1
my	1
wrist	1
as	1
before	1
again	1
i	1
awoke	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
found	1
lucy	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
still	1
asleep	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
quietly	1
and	1
pulling	1
aside	1
the	1
blind	1
looked	1
out	1
it	1
was	1
brilliant	1
moonlight	1
and	1
the	1
soft	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
sky	1
merged	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
great	1
silent	1
mystery	1
was	1
beautiful	1
beyond	1
words	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
moonlight	1
flitted	1
a	1
great	1
bat	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
in	1
great	1
whirling	1
circles	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
it	1
came	1
quite	1
close	1
but	1
was	1
i	1
suppose	1
frightened	1
at	1
seeing	1
me	1
and	1
flitted	1
away	1
across	1
the	1
harbour	1
towards	1
the	1
abbey	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
lucy	1
had	1
lain	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
was	1
sleeping	1
peacefully	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
again	1
all	1
night	1
14	1
august	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
reading	1
and	1
writing	1
all	1
day	1
lucy	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
spot	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
for	1
lunch	1
or	1
tea	1
or	1
dinner	1
this	1
afternoon	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
funny	1
remark	1
we	1
were	1
coming	1
home	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
steps	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
pier	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
view	1
as	1
we	1
generally	1
do	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
low	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
just	1
dropping	1
behind	1
kettleness	1
the	1
red	1
light	1
was	1
thrown	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
abbey	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
bathe	1
everything	1
in	1
a	1
beautiful	1
rosy	1
glow	1
we	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
suddenly	1
lucy	1
murmured	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
herself	1
his	1
red	1
eyes	1
again	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
odd	1
expression	1
coming	1
apropos	1
of	1
nothing	1
that	1
it	1
quite	1
startled	1
me	1
i	1
slewed	1
round	1
a	1
little	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
see	1
lucy	1
well	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
halfdreamy	1
state	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
followed	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
over	1
at	1
our	1
own	1
seat	1
whereon	1
was	1
a	1
dark	1
figure	1
seated	1
alone	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
myself	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
stranger	1
had	1
great	1
eyes	1
like	1
burning	1
flames	1
but	1
a	1
second	1
look	1
dispelled	1
the	1
illusion	1
the	1
red	1
sunlight	1
was	1
shining	1
on	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
st	1
marys	1
church	1
behind	1
our	1
seat	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
dipped	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
sufficient	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
refraction	1
and	1
reflection	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
light	1
moved	1
i	1
called	1
lucys	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
peculiar	1
effect	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
herself	1
with	1
a	1
start	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
sad	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
terrible	1
night	1
up	1
there	1
we	1
never	1
refer	1
to	1
it	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
dinner	1
lucy	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
and	1
went	1
early	1
to	1
bed	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
asleep	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
stroll	1
myself	1
i	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
cliffs	1
to	1
the	1
westward	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
sweet	1
sadness	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
jonathan	1
when	1
coming	1
home	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
bright	1
moonlight	1
so	1
bright	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
our	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crescent	1
was	1
in	1
shadow	1
everything	1
could	1
be	1
well	1
seen	1
i	1
threw	1
a	1
glance	1
up	1
at	1
our	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
lucys	1
head	1
leaning	1
out	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
opened	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
waved	1
it	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
or	1
make	1
any	1
movement	1
whatever	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
moonlight	1
crept	1
round	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1

by	1
her	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1

was	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
goodsized	1
bird	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
she	1
might	1
get	1
a	1
chill	1
so	1
i	1
ran	1
upstairs	1

heavily	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1

to	1
protect	1
it	1
from	1

not	1
wake	1

paler	1

and	1
there	1

a	1
drawn	1
haggard	1
look	1
under	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
i	1
do	1
not	1

by	1

at	1

out	1

up	1

when	1
i	1

to	1
restore	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
weak	1
as	1
water	1
and	1
cried	1
silently	1
between	1
long	1
painful	1
struggles	1
for	1
breath	1
when	1
i	1
asked	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1

not	1

that	1
unlucky	1
prick	1
of	1

looked	1
at	1

write	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
churchyard	1
lucy	1
is	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
last	1
night	1
she	1
slept	1
well	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
disturb	1
me	1
once	1
the	1
roses	1
seem	1
coming	1
back	1
already	1
to	1
her	1
cheeks	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
still	1
sadly	1
pale	1
and	1
wanlooking	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
anaemic	1
i	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
gay	1
spirits	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
all	1
the	1
morbid	1
reticence	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
passed	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
just	1
reminded	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
needed	1
any	1
reminding	1
of	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
very	1
seat	1
i	1
found	1
her	1
asleep	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
she	1
tapped	1
playfully	1
with	1
the	1
heel	1
of	1
her	1
boot	1
on	1
the	1
stone	1
slab	1
and	1
said	1
my	1
poor	1
little	1
feet	1
didnt	1
make	1
much	1
noise	1
then	1
i	1
daresay	1
poor	1
old	1
mr	1
swales	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
i	1
didnt	1
want	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
geordie	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
communicative	1
humour	1
i	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
dreamed	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
before	1
she	1
answered	1
that	1
sweet	1
puckered	1
look	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
forehead	1
which	1
arthur	1
i	1
call	1
him	1
arthur	1
from	1
her	1
habit	1
says	1
he	1
loves	1
and	1
indeed	1
i	1
dont	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
halfdreaming	1
kind	1
of	1
way	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
to	1
herself	1
i	1
didnt	1
quite	1
dream	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
real	1
i	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
spot	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
why	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
something	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
remember	1
though	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
was	1
asleep	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
a	1
fish	1
leaped	1
as	1
i	1
went	1
by	1
and	1
i	1
leaned	1
over	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
dogs	1
howling	1
the	1
whole	1
town	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
dogs	1
all	1
howling	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
i	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
then	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
vague	1
memory	1
of	1
something	1
long	1
and	1
dark	1
with	1
red	1
eyes	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
sunset	1
and	1
something	1
very	1
sweet	1
and	1
very	1
bitter	1
all	1
around	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
seemed	1
sinking	1
into	1
deep	1
green	1
water	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
singing	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
drowning	1
men	1
and	1
then	1
everything	1
seemed	1
passing	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
soul	1
seemed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
my	1
body	1
and	1
float	1
about	1
the	1
air	1
i	1
seem	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
once	1
the	1
west	1
lighthouse	1
was	1
right	1
under	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
agonising	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
earthquake	1
and	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
found	1
you	1
shaking	1
my	1
body	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
before	1
i	1
felt	1
you	1
then	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
it	1
seemed	1
a	1
little	1
uncanny	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
breathlessly	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
like	1
it	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
so	1
we	1
drifted	1
on	1
to	1
other	1
subjects	1
and	1
lucy	1
was	1
like	1
her	1
old	1
self	1
again	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
home	1
the	1
fresh	1
breeze	1
had	1
braced	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
her	1
pale	1
cheeks	1
were	1
really	1
more	1
rosy	1
her	1
mother	1
rejoiced	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
spent	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
evening	1
together	1

not	1
lightly	1
die	1
away	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
written	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
we	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
him	1
nothing	1
that	1

one	1
could	1
understand	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
the	1

the	1
guard	1
was	1
told	1
by	1
the	1
stationmaster	1
there	1
that	1
he	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
station	1
shouting	1
for	1
a	1
ticket	1
for	1
home	1
seeing	1
from	1

won	1
all	1

19	1
august	1
strange	1
and	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
renfield	1
last	1
night	1
about	1
eight	1
oclock	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
excited	1
and	1
to	1
sniff	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
dog	1
does	1
when	1
setting	1
the	1
attendant	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
and	1
knowing	1
my	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
encouraged	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
he	1
is	1
usually	1
respectful	1
to	1
the	1
attendant	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
servile	1
but	1
tonight	1
the	1
man	1
tells	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
haughty	1
would	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
all	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
was	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
you	1
dont	1
count	1
now	1
the	1
master	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
the	1
attendant	1
thinks	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
sudden	1
form	1
of	1
religious	1
mania	1
which	1
has	1
seized	1
him	1
if	1
so	1
we	1
must	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
squalls	1
for	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
with	1
homicidal	1
and	1
religious	1
mania	1
at	1
once	1
might	1
be	1
dangerous	1
the	1
combination	1
is	1
a	1
dreadful	1
one	1
at	1
nine	1
oclock	1
i	1
visited	1
him	1
myself	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
attendant	1
in	1
his	1
sublime	1
selffeeling	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
myself	1
and	1
attendant	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
nothing	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
religious	1
mania	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
soon	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
god	1
these	1
infinitesimal	1
distinctions	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
man	1
are	1
too	1
paltry	1
for	1
an	1
omnipotent	1
being	1
how	1
these	1
madmen	1
give	1
themselves	1
away	1
the	1
real	1
god	1
taketh	1
heed	1
lest	1
a	1
sparrow	1
fall	1
but	1
the	1
god	1
created	1
from	1
human	1
vanity	1
sees	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
an	1
eagle	1
and	1
a	1
sparrow	1
oh	1
if	1
men	1
only	1
knew	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
renfield	1
kept	1
getting	1
excited	1
in	1
greater	1
and	1
greater	1
degree	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
watching	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
kept	1
strict	1
observation	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
shifty	1
look	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
we	1
always	1
see	1
when	1
a	1
madman	1
has	1
seized	1
an	1
idea	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
shifty	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
back	1
which	1
asylum	1
attendants	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
became	1
quite	1
quiet	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
bed	1
resignedly	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
space	1
with	1
lacklustre	1
eyes	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
find	1
out	1
if	1
his	1
apathy	1
were	1
real	1
or	1
only	1
assumed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
pets	1
a	1
theme	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
excite	1
his	1
attention	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
said	1
testily	1
bother	1
them	1
all	1
i	1
dont	1
care	1
a	1
pin	1
about	1
them	1
what	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
dont	1
mean	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
you	1
dont	1
care	1
about	1
spiders	1
spiders	1
at	1
present	1
are	1
his	1
hobby	1
and	1
the	1
notebook	1
is	1
filling	1
up	1
with	1
columns	1
of	1
small	1
figures	1
to	1
this	1
he	1
answered	1
enigmatically	1
the	1
bridemaidens	1
rejoice	1
the	1
eyes	1
that	1
wait	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
bride	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
then	1
the	1
maidens	1
shine	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
that	1
are	1
filled	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
explain	1
himself	1
but	1
remained	1
obstinately	1
seated	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
remained	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
weary	1
tonight	1
and	1
low	1
in	1
spirits	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
think	1
of	1
lucy	1
and	1
how	1
different	1
things	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
if	1

a	1

had	1
escaped	1
i	1
threw	1
on	1
my	1
clothes	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
at	1
once	1
my	1
patient	1
is	1
too	1
dangerous	1
a	1
person	1
to	1
be	1
roaming	1
about	1
those	1
ideas	1
of	1
his	1
might	1
work	1
out	1
dangerously	1
with	1
strangers	1
the	1
attendant	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
not	1
ten	1
minutes	1
before	1
seemingly	1
asleep	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
through	1
the	1
observationtrap	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
being	1
wrenched	1
out	1
he	1
ran	1
back	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
feet	1
disappear	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
sent	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
nightgear	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
far	1
off	1
the	1
attendant	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
useful	1
to	1
watch	1
where	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
than	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
whilst	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
bulky	1
man	1
and	1
couldnt	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
am	1
thin	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
aid	1
i	1
got	1
out	1
but	1
feet	1
foremost	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
above	1
ground	1
landed	1
unhurt	1
the	1
attendant	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
patient	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
straight	1
line	1
so	1
i	1
ran	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
as	1
i	1
got	1
through	1
the	1
belt	1
of	1
trees	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
figure	1
scale	1
the	1
high	1
wall	1
which	1
separates	1
our	1
grounds	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
house	1
i	1
ran	1
back	1
at	1
once	1
told	1
the	1
watchman	1
to	1
get	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
men	1
immediately	1
and	1
follow	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
carfax	1
in	1
case	1
our	1
friend	1
might	1
be	1
dangerous	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
ladder	1
myself	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
wall	1
dropped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
renfields	1
figure	1
just	1
disappearing	1
behind	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
i	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
pressed	1
close	1
against	1
the	1
old	1
ironbound	1
oak	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
chapel	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
apparently	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
lest	1
i	1
might	1
frighten	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
should	1
run	1
off	1
chasing	1
an	1
errant	1
swarm	1
of	1
bees	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
following	1
a	1
naked	1
lunatic	1
when	1
the	1
fit	1
of	1
escaping	1
is	1
upon	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
however	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
note	1
of	1
anything	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
ventured	1
to	1
draw	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
my	1
men	1
had	1
now	1
crossed	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
were	1
closing	1
him	1
in	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
i	1
am	1
here	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
bidding	1
master	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
slave	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
reward	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
faithful	1
i	1
have	1
worshipped	1
you	1
long	1
and	1
afar	1
off	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
near	1
i	1
await	1
your	1
commands	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
me	1
by	1
will	1
you	1
dear	1
master	1
in	1
your	1
distribution	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
selfish	1
old	1
beggar	1
anyhow	1
he	1
thinks	1
of	1
the	1
loaves	1
and	1
fishes	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
believes	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
presence	1
his	1
manias	1
make	1
a	1
startling	1
combination	1
when	1
we	1
closed	1
in	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
fought	1
like	1
a	1
tiger	1
he	1
is	1
immensely	1
strong	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
lunatic	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
rage	1
before	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mercy	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
his	1
danger	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
with	1
strength	1
and	1
determination	1
like	1
his	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
wild	1
work	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
caged	1
he	1
is	1
safe	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

lucy	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
anxious	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
since	1
we	1
parted	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
at	1
whitby	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
hull	1
all	1
right	1

caught	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
homburg	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
train	1
on	1
here	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
hardly	1
recall	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
except	1
that	1
i	1
knew	1
i	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
jonathan	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
nursing	1
i	1
had	1
better	1
get	1
all	1
the	1
sleep	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
found	1
my	1
dear	1
one	1
oh	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
weaklooking	1
all	1
the	1
resolution	1
has	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
eyes	1
and	1
that	1
quiet	1
dignity	1
which	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
has	1
vanished	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
wreck	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
remember	1
anything	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
wants	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
so	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
ask	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
some	1
terrible	1
shock	1
and	1
i	1
fear	1
it	1
might	1
tax	1
his	1
poor	1
brain	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
sister	1
agatha	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
creature	1
and	1
a	1
born	1
nurse	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
raved	1
of	1
dreadful	1
things	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
i	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
cross	1
herself	1
and	1
say	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
tell	1
that	1
the	1
ravings	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
were	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
god	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
nurse	1
through	1
her	1
vocation	1
should	1
hear	1
them	1
she	1
should	1
respect	1
her	1
trust	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
good	1
soul	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
i	1
was	1
troubled	1
she	1
opened	1
up	1
the	1
subject	1
again	1
and	1
after	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
mention	1
what	1
my	1
poor	1
dear	1
raved	1
about	1
added	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
much	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
about	1
anything	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
wrong	1
himself	1
and	1
you	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
be	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
concerned	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
forgotten	1
you	1
or	1
what	1
he	1
owes	1
to	1
you	1
his	1
fear	1
was	1
of	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
things	1
which	1
no	1
mortal	1
can	1
treat	1
of	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
the	1
dear	1
soul	1
thought	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
jealous	1
lest	1
my	1
poor	1
dear	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
girl	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
jealous	1
about	1
jonathan	1
and	1
yet	1
my	1
dear	1
let	1
me	1
whisper	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
joy	1
through	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
no	1
other	1
woman	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
trouble	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
sitting	1
by	1
his	1
bedside	1
where	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
while	1
he	1
sleeps	1
he	1
is	1
waking	1
when	1
he	1
woke	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
for	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
pocket	1
i	1
asked	1
sister	1
agatha	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
all	1
his	1
things	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
amongst	1
them	1
was	1
his	1
notebook	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
then	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
find	1
some	1
clue	1
to	1
his	1
trouble	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
wish	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
saying	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
alone	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
me	1
back	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
notebook	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
solemnly	1
wilhelmina	1
i	1
knew	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
deadly	1
earnest	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
since	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
him	1
you	1
know	1
dear	1
my	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
trust	1
between	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
secret	1
no	1
concealment	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
shock	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
try	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
feel	1
my	1
head	1
spin	1
round	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
real	1
or	1
the	1
dreaming	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
brain	1
fever	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
mad	1
the	1
secret	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
life	1
here	1
with	1
our	1
marriage	1
for	1
my	1
dear	1
we	1
had	1

after	1

he	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
propped	1
up	1
with	1
pillows	1
he	1
answered	1
his	1
i	1
will	1
firmly	1
and	1
strongly	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
speak	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
that	1
even	1
those	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
choke	1
me	1
the	1
dear	1
sisters	1
were	1
so	1
kind	1
please	1
god	1
i	1

the	1
grave	1
and	1
sweet	1
responsibilities	1
i	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
wedding	1
present	1
when	1
the	1
chaplain	1
and	1
the	1
sisters	1
had	1
left	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
my	1
husband	1
oh	1
lucy	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
words	1
my	1
husband	1
left	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
my	1
husband	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
pillow	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
white	1
paper	1
and	1
tied	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
pale	1
blue	1
ribbon	1
which	1
was	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
sealed	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
knot	1
with	1
sealingwax	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
seal	1
i	1
used	1
my	1
wedding	1
ring	1
then	1
i	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
keep	1
it	1
so	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
outward	1
and	1
visible	1
sign	1
for	1
us	1
all	1
our	1
lives	1
that	1
we	1
trusted	1
each	1
other	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
never	1
open	1
it	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
dear	1
sake	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
some	1
stern	1
duty	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
oh	1
lucy	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
wifes	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
dearest	1
thing	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wide	1
world	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
again	1
to	1
win	1
it	1
if	1
need	1
be	1
the	1
poor	1
dear	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
think	1
of	1
time	1
yet	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
wonder	1
if	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
mixes	1
up	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
month	1
but	1
the	1
year	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
woman	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wide	1
world	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
except	1
myself	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
trust	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
these	1
went	1
my	1
love	1
and	1
duty	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
dear	1
when	1
he	1
kissed	1
me	1
and	1
drew	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
poor	1
weak	1
hands	1
it	1
was	1

a	1
very	1
solemn	1
pledge	1
between	1
us	1

not	1

a	1
cormorant	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
sleep	1
well	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
quite	1
given	1
up	1
walking	1
in	1
my	1
sleep	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
stirred	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
bed	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
that	1
is	1
when	1
i	1
once	1
got	1
into	1
it	1
at	1
night	1
arthur	1
says	1
i	1
am	1
getting	1
fat	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
i	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
arthur	1
is	1
here	1
we	1
have	1
such	1
walks	1
and	1
drives	1
and	1
rides	1
and	1
rowing	1
and	1
tennis	1
and	1
fishing	1
together	1
and	1
i	1
love	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
more	1
but	1
i	1
doubt	1
that	1
for	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
couldnt	1
love	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
then	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
nonsense	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
calling	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
no	1
more	1
just	1
at	1
present	1
from	1

the	1
case	1
of	1
renfield	1
grows	1
even	1
more	1
interesting	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
so	1
far	1
quieted	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
spells	1
or	1
cessation	1
from	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
week	1
after	1
his	1
attack	1
he	1
was	1
perpetually	1
violent	1
then	1
one	1
night	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
rose	1
he	1
grew	1
quiet	1
and	1
kept	1
murmuring	1
to	1
himself	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
wait	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
wait	1
the	1
attendant	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
ran	1
down	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
straitwaistcoat	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
padded	1
room	1
but	1
the	1
suffused	1
look	1
had	1
gone	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
their	1
old	1
pleading	1
i	1
might	1
almost	1
say	1
cringing	1
softness	1
i	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
present	1
condition	1
and	1
directed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
relieved	1
the	1
attendants	1
hesitated	1
but	1
finally	1
carried	1
out	1
my	1
wishes	1
without	1
protest	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
patient	1
had	1
humour	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
distrust	1
for	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
looking	1
furtively	1
at	1
them	1
they	1
think	1
i	1
could	1
hurt	1
you	1
fancy	1
me	1
hurting	1
you	1
the	1
fools	1
it	1
was	1
soothing	1
somehow	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
to	1
find	1
myself	1
dissociated	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
this	1
poor	1
madman	1
from	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
follow	1
his	1
thought	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
anything	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
stand	1
together	1
or	1
has	1
he	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
me	1
some	1
good	1
so	1
stupendous	1
that	1
my	1
wellbeing	1
is	1
needful	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
later	1
on	1
tonight	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
even	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
a	1
kitten	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
fullgrown	1
cat	1
will	1
not	1
tempt	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
only	1
say	1
i	1
dont	1
take	1
any	1
stock	1
in	1
cats	1
i	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
wait	1
i	1
can	1
wait	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
i	1
left	1
him	1
the	1
attendant	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quiet	1
until	1
just	1
before	1
dawn	1
and	1
that	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
uneasy	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
violent	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
paroxysm	1
which	1
exhausted	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
swooned	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
coma	1
three	1
nights	1
has	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
violent	1
all	1
day	1
then	1
quiet	1
from	1
moonrise	1
to	1
sunrise	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
some	1
clue	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
it	1
would	1
almost	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
influence	1
which	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
happy	1
thought	1
we	1
shall	1
tonight	1
play	1
sane	1
wits	1
against	1
mad	1
ones	1
he	1
escaped	1
before	1
without	1
our	1
help	1
tonight	1
he	1
shall	1
escape	1
with	1
it	1
we	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
chance	1
and	1
have	1

to	1
shut	1

the	1

was	1
entering	1
the	1

to	1

then	1
he	1
dashed	1
out	1
past	1
him	1
and	1
new	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
i	1
sent	1
word	1
for	1
the	1
attendants	1
to	1

again	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
house	1
and	1
we	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
pressed	1
against	1
the	1
old	1
chapel	1
door	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1

had	1
not	1
the	1
attendants	1
seized	1
him	1
in	1
time	1
he	1
would	1
have	1

to	1
kill	1
me	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
a	1
strange	1
thing	1
happened	1
he	1
suddenly	1
redoubled	1
his	1
efforts	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
calm	1
i	1
looked	1
round	1
instinctively	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
then	1
i	1
caught	1
the	1
patients	1
eye	1
and	1
followed	1
it	1
but	1
could	1
trace	1
nothing	1
as	1
it	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
moonlit	1
sky	1
except	1
a	1
big	1
bat	1
which	1
was	1
flapping	1
its	1
silent	1
and	1
ghostly	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
bats	1
usually	1
wheel	1
and	1
flit	1
about	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
on	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
knew	1
where	1
it	1
was	1

for	1

had	1
some	1
intention	1

there	1
is	1
something	1

so	1
unhappy	1
last	1

to	1
be	1
dreaming	1
again	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
whitby	1
perhaps	1
it	1

i	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
vague	1
fear	1
and	1
i	1
feel	1
so	1
weak	1
and	1
worn	1
out	1
when	1
arthur	1
came	1
to	1

he	1
looked	1
quite	1

i	1
hadnt	1
the	1

she	1
fears	1

i	1
tried	1
to	1

awake	1

for	1
a	1
while	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
twelve	1
it	1
waked	1
me	1
from	1
a	1

i	1
must	1

been	1
falling	1

was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
scratching	1

at	1
the	1
window	1

i	1

it	1

i	1
hasten	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
in	1
my	1

there	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
functional	1
disturbance	1
or	1
any	1
malady	1
that	1
i	1

time	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
satisfied	1
with	1
her	1
appearance	1
she	1
is	1
woefully	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
last	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
must	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
full	1
opportunity	1
of	1
examination	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
wish	1
our	1
very	1
friendship	1
makes	1
a	1
little	1
difficulty	1
which	1
not	1
even	1
medical	1
science	1
or	1
custom	1
can	1
bridge	1
over	1
i	1
had	1
better	1
tell	1
you	1
exactly	1
what	1
happened	1
leaving	1
you	1
to	1
draw	1
in	1
a	1
measure	1
your	1
own	1
conclusions	1
i	1
shall	1
then	1
say	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
propose	1
doing	1
i	1
found	1
miss	1
westenra	1
in	1
seemingly	1
gay	1
spirits	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
present	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
i	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
trying	1
all	1
she	1
knew	1
to	1
mislead	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
being	1
anxious	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
guesses	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
need	1
of	1
caution	1
there	1
is	1
we	1
lunched	1
alone	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
all	1
exerted	1
ourselves	1
to	1
be	1
cheerful	1
we	1
got	1
as	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
reward	1
for	1
our	1
labours	1
some	1
real	1
cheerfulness	1
amongst	1
us	1
then	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
went	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
lucy	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
me	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
and	1
till	1
we	1
got	1
there	1
her	1
gaiety	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed	1
however	1
the	1
mask	1
fell	1
from	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
sank	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
sigh	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
high	1
spirits	1
had	1
failed	1
i	1
at	1
once	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
her	1
reaction	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
diagnosis	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
sweetly	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
i	1
loathe	1
talking	1
about	1
myself	1
i	1
reminded	1
her	1
that	1
a	1
doctors	1
confidence	1
was	1
sacred	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
grievously	1
anxious	1
about	1
her	1
she	1
caught	1
on	1
to	1
my	1
meaning	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
settled	1
that	1
matter	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
tell	1
arthur	1
everything	1
you	1
choose	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
myself	1
but	1
all	1
for	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
free	1
i	1
could	1
easily	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
somewhat	1
bloodless	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
usual	1
anaemic	1
signs	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
chance	1
i	1
was	1
actually	1
able	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
for	1
in	1
opening	1
a	1
window	1
which	1
was	1
stiff	1
a	1
cord	1
gave	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
cut	1
her	1
hand	1
slightly	1
with	1
broken	1
glass	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
slight	1
matter	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
an	1
evident	1
chance	1
and	1
i	1
secured	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
have	1
analysed	1
them	1
the	1
qualitative	1
analysis	1
gives	1
a	1
quite	1
normal	1
condition	1
and	1
shows	1
i	1
should	1
infer	1
in	1
itself	1
a	1
vigorous	1
state	1
of	1
health	1
in	1
other	1
physical	1
matters	1
i	1
was	1
quite	1
satisfied	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
anxiety	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
cause	1
somewhere	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
mental	1
she	1
complains	1
of	1
difficulty	1
in	1
breathing	1
satisfactorily	1
at	1
times	1
and	1
of	1
heavy	1
lethargic	1
sleep	1
with	1
dreams	1
that	1
frighten	1
her	1
but	1
regarding	1
which	1
she	1
can	1
remember	1
nothing	1
she	1
says	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
in	1
whitby	1
the	1
habit	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
that	1
once	1
she	1
walked	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
cliff	1
where	1
miss	1
murray	1
found	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
assures	1
me	1
that	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
habit	1
has	1
not	1
returned	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
doubt	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
master	1
professor	1
van	1
helsing	1
of	1
amsterdam	1
who	1
knows	1
as	1
much	1
about	1
obscure	1
diseases	1
as	1
any	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
have	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
charge	1
i	1
have	1
mentioned	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
miss	1

this	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
is	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
your	1
wishes	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
too	1
proud	1
and	1
happy	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
i	1
can	1
for	1
her	1
van	1
helsing	1
would	1
i	1
know	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
personal	1
reason	1
so	1
no	1
matter	1
on	1
what	1
ground	1
he	1
comes	1
we	1
must	1
accept	1
his	1
wishes	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
seemingly	1
arbitrary	1
man	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
talking	1
about	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
philosopher	1
and	1
a	1
metaphysician	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
advanced	1
scientists	1
of	1
his	1
day	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
i	1
believe	1
an	1
absolutely	1
open	1
mind	1
this	1
with	1
an	1

both	1

my	1
dear	1
art	1
van	1
helsing	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
gone	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
hillingham	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
by	1
lucys	1
discretion	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
lunching	1
out	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
van	1
helsing	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
advise	1
you	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
present	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
is	1
i	1
fear	1
much	1
concerned	1
but	1
says	1
he	1
must	1
think	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
our	1
friendship	1
and	1
how	1
you	1
trust	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
must	1
tell	1
him	1
all	1
you	1
think	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
guess	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
nay	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
jesting	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
jest	1
but	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
perhaps	1
more	1
i	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
serious	1
this	1
was	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
having	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
before	1
starting	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
amsterdam	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
any	1
further	1
clue	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
art	1
because	1
his	1
very	1
reticence	1
means	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
brains	1
are	1
working	1
for	1
her	1
good	1
he	1
will	1
speak	1
plainly	1
enough	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
be	1
sure	1
so	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
would	1
simply	1
write	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
our	1
visit	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
doing	1
a	1
descriptive	1
special	1
article	1
for	1
the	1
dally	1
telegraph	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
but	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
smuts	1
in	1
london	1
were	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
report	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
possible	1
make	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
visit	1
lucy	1
was	1
more	1
cheerful	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
certainly	1
looked	1
better	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
ghastly	1
look	1
that	1
so	1
upset	1
you	1
and	1
her	1
breathing	1
was	1
normal	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sweet	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
is	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
at	1
ease	1
though	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
hard	1
struggle	1
for	1
it	1
i	1
believe	1
van	1
helsing	1
saw	1
it	1
too	1
for	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
quick	1
look	1
under	1
his	1
bushy	1
brows	1
that	1
i	1
knew	1
of	1
old	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
chat	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
except	1
ourselves	1
and	1
diseases	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
infinite	1
geniality	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
poor	1
lucys	1
pretense	1
of	1
animation	1
merge	1
into	1
reality	1
then	1
without	1
any	1
seeming	1
change	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
conversation	1
gently	1
round	1
to	1
his	1
visit	1
and	1
suavely	1
said	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
miss	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
so	1
great	1
pleasure	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
much	1
beloved	1
that	1
is	1
much	1
my	1
dear	1
even	1
were	1
there	1
that	1
which	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
ghastly	1
pale	1
to	1
them	1
i	1
say	1
pouf	1
and	1
he	1
snapped	1
his	1
fingers	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
but	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
show	1
them	1
how	1
wrong	1
they	1
are	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
and	1
gesture	1
as	1
that	1
with	1
which	1
once	1
he	1
pointed	1
me	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
class	1
on	1
or	1
rather	1
after	1
a	1
particular	1
occasion	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
fails	1
to	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
ladies	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
madams	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
back	1
to	1
happiness	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
oh	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
rewards	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
bestow	1
such	1
happiness	1
but	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
wife	1
nor	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
do	1
not	1
tell	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
like	1
me	1
who	1
have	1
known	1
so	1
many	1
sorrows	1
and	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
them	1
so	1
my	1
dear	1
we	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
smoke	1
the	1
cigarette	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
whiles	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
little	1
talk	1
all	1
to	1
ourselves	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
hint	1
and	1
strolled	1
about	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
professor	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
in	1
he	1
looked	1
grave	1
but	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
careful	1
examination	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
functional	1
cause	1
with	1
you	1

september	1
zoophagous	1
patient	1
still	1
keeps	1
up	1
our	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
outburst	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
yesterday	1
at	1
an	1
unusual	1
time	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
noon	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
restless	1
the	1
attendant	1
knew	1
the	1
symptoms	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
summoned	1
aid	1
fortunately	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
at	1
a	1
run	1
and	1
were	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
noon	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
violent	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
their	1
strength	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
about	1
five	1
minutes	1
however	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
quiet	1
and	1
finally	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
melancholy	1
in	1
which	1
state	1
he	1
has	1
remained	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
the	1
attendant	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
screams	1
whilst	1
in	1
the	1
paroxysm	1
were	1
really	1
appalling	1
i	1
found	1
my	1
hands	1
full	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
patients	1
who	1
were	1
frightened	1
by	1
him	1
indeed	1
i	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
the	1
effect	1
for	1
the	1
sounds	1
disturbed	1
even	1
me	1
though	1
i	1
was	1
some	1
distance	1
away	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
after	1
the	1
dinnerhour	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
and	1
as	1
yet	1
my	1
patient	1
sits	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
brooding	1
with	1
a	1
dull	1
sullen	1
woebegone	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
seems	1
rather	1
to	1
indicate	1
than	1
to	1
show	1
something	1
directly	1
i	1
cannot	1
quite	1
understand	1
it	1
later	1
another	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
patient	1
at	1
five	1
oclock	1
i	1
looked	1
in	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
seemingly	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
was	1
catching	1
flies	1
and	1
eating	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
keeping	1
note	1
of	1
his	1
capture	1
by	1
making	1
nailmarks	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
between	1
the	1
ridges	1
of	1
padding	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1
came	1
over	1
and	1
apologised	1
for	1
his	1
bad	1
conduct	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
cringing	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
notebook	1
again	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
humour	1
him	1
so	1
he	1
is	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
window	1
open	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
sugar	1
of	1
his	1
tea	1
spread	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
windowsill	1
and	1
is	1
reaping	1
quite	1
a	1
harvest	1
of	1
flies	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
now	1
eating	1
them	1
but	1
putting	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
box	1
as	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
is	1
already	1
examining	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
spider	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
past	1
few	1
days	1
for	1
any	1
clue	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
immense	1
help	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
rise	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
faraway	1
voice	1
as	1
though	1
saying	1
it	1
rather	1
to	1
himself	1
than	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
over	1
all	1
over	1
he	1
has	1
deserted	1
me	1
no	1
hope	1
for	1
me	1
now	1
unless	1
i	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
myself	1
then	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
resolute	1
way	1
he	1
said	1
doctor	1
wont	1
you	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
sugar	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
flies	1
i	1
said	1
yes	1
the	1
flies	1
like	1
it	1
too	1
and	1
i	1
like	1
the	1
flies	1
therefore	1
i	1
like	1
it	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
people	1
who	1
know	1
so	1
little	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
madmen	1
do	1
not	1
argue	1
i	1
procured	1
him	1
a	1
double	1
supply	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
as	1
happy	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
i	1
suppose	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
fathom	1
his	1
mind	1
midnight	1
another	1
change	1
in	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
miss	1
westenra	1
whom	1
i	1
found	1
much	1
better	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
and	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
our	1
own	1
gate	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sunset	1
when	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
yelling	1
as	1
his	1
room	1
is	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
wonderful	1
smoky	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
sunset	1
over	1
london	1
with	1
its	1
lurid	1
lights	1
and	1
inky	1
shadows	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
marvellous	1
tints	1
that	1
come	1
on	1
foul	1
clouds	1
even	1
as	1
on	1
foul	1
water	1
and	1
to	1
realise	1
all	1
the	1
grim	1
sternness	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
cold	1
stone	1
building	1
with	1
its	1
wealth	1
of	1
breathing	1
misery	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
desolate	1
heart	1
to	1
endure	1
it	1
all	1
i	1
reached	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
going	1
down	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
window	1
saw	1
the	1
red	1
disc	1
sink	1
as	1
it	1
sank	1
he	1
became	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
frenzied	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
dipped	1
he	1
slid	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
that	1
held	1
him	1
an	1
inert	1
mass	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
however	1
what	1
intellectual	1
recuperative	1
power	1
lunatics	1
have	1
for	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
quite	1
calmly	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
i	1
signalled	1
to	1
the	1
attendants	1
not	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
brushed	1
out	1
the	1
crumbs	1
of	1
sugar	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
flybox	1
and	1
emptied	1
it	1
outside	1
and	1
threw	1
away	1
the	1
box	1
then	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
crossing	1
over	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
all	1
this	1
surprised	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
keep	1
flies	1
any	1
more	1
no	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
rubbish	1
he	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
interesting	1
study	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
sudden	1
passion	1
stop	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
clue	1
after	1
all	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
find	1
why	1
today	1
his	1
paroxysms	1
came	1
on	1
at	1
high	1
noon	1
and	1
at	1
sunset	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
malign	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
periods	1

lucy	1
this	1
morning	1
has	1
gone	1
back	1
a	1
bit	1
there	1
is	1
however	1
one	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
has	1
arisen	1
from	1
it	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
was	1
naturally	1
anxious	1
concerning	1
lucy	1
and	1
has	1
consulted	1
me	1
professionally	1
about	1
her	1
i	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
van	1
helsing	1
the	1
great	1
specialist	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
charge	1
conjointly	1
with	1
myself	1
so	1
now	1
we	1
can	1
come	1
and	1
go	1
without	1
alarming	1
her	1
unduly	1
for	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
her	1
would	1
mean	1
sudden	1
death	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
lucys	1
weak	1
condition	1
might	1
be	1
disastrous	1
to	1
her	1
we	1
are	1
hedged	1
in	1
with	1
difficulties	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
my	1
poor	1
old	1
fellow	1
but	1
please	1
god	1
we	1
shall	1
come	1
through	1
them	1
all	1
right	1
if	1
any	1

a	1
letter	1
simply	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
coming	1
as	1
miss	1
westenra	1

that	1
i	1
should	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
if	1
need	1
be	1
right	1
my	1
friend	1
he	1
said	1
quite	1
right	1
better	1
he	1
not	1
know	1
as	1
yet	1
perhaps	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
i	1
pray	1
so	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
needed	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
all	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
friend	1
john	1
let	1
me	1
caution	1
you	1
you	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
madmen	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
mad	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
you	1
deal	1
discreetly	1
with	1
your	1
madmen	1
so	1
deal	1
with	1
gods	1
madmen	1
too	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
you	1
tell	1
not	1
your	1
madmen	1
what	1
you	1
do	1
nor	1
why	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
you	1
tell	1
them	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
you	1
shall	1
keep	1
knowledge	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
may	1
rest	1
where	1
it	1
may	1
gather	1
its	1
kind	1
around	1
it	1
and	1
breed	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
keep	1
as	1
yet	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
here	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
touched	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
then	1
touched	1
himself	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
i	1
have	1
for	1
myself	1
thoughts	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
later	1
i	1
shall	1
unfold	1
to	1
you	1
why	1
not	1
now	1
i	1
asked	1
it	1
may	1
do	1
some	1
good	1
we	1
may	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
decision	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
my	1
friend	1
john	1
when	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
grown	1
even	1
before	1
it	1
has	1
ripened	1
while	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
its	1
motherearth	1
is	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
sunshine	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
begun	1
to	1
paint	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
gold	1
the	1
husbandman	1
he	1
pull	1
the	1
ear	1
and	1
rub	1
him	1
between	1
his	1
rough	1
hands	1
and	1
blow	1
away	1
the	1
green	1
chaff	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
look	1
hes	1
good	1
corn	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
good	1
crop	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
application	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
for	1
reply	1
he	1
reached	1
over	1
and	1
took	1
my	1
ear	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pulled	1
it	1
playfully	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
lectures	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
husbandman	1
tell	1
you	1
so	1
then	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
but	1
not	1
till	1
then	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
good	1
husbandman	1
dig	1
up	1
his	1
planted	1
corn	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
grow	1
that	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
play	1
at	1
husbandry	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
life	1
see	1
you	1
now	1
friend	1
john	1
i	1
have	1
sown	1
my	1
corn	1
and	1
nature	1
has	1
her	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
making	1
it	1
sprout	1
if	1
he	1
sprout	1
at	1
all	1
theres	1
some	1
promise	1
and	1
i	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
ear	1
begins	1
to	1
swell	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
for	1
he	1
evidently	1
saw	1
that	1
i	1
understood	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
very	1
gravely	1
you	1
were	1
always	1
a	1
careful	1
student	1
and	1
your	1
casebook	1
was	1
ever	1
more	1
full	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
you	1
were	1
only	1
student	1
then	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
master	1
and	1
i	1
trust	1
that	1
good	1
habit	1
have	1
not	1
fail	1
remember	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
knowledge	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
memory	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
the	1
weaker	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
good	1
practise	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
case	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
miss	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
mind	1
i	1
say	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
interest	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
kick	1
the	1
beam	1
as	1
your	1
peoples	1
say	1
take	1
then	1
good	1
note	1
of	1
it	1
nothing	1
is	1
too	1
small	1
i	1
counsel	1
you	1
put	1
down	1
in	1
record	1
even	1
your	1
doubts	1
and	1
surmises	1
hereafter	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
true	1
you	1
guess	1
we	1
learn	1
from	1
failure	1
not	1
from	1
success	1
when	1
i	1
described	1
lucys	1
symptoms	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
before	1
but	1
infinitely	1
more	1
marked	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
grave	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
bag	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
many	1
instruments	1
and	1
drugs	1
the	1
ghastly	1
paraphernalia	1
of	1
our	1
beneficial	1
trade	1
as	1
he	1
once	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
lectures	1
the	1
equipment	1
of	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
the	1
healing	1
craft	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
shown	1
in	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
met	1
us	1
she	1
was	1
alarmed	1
but	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
i	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
nature	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
beneficent	1
moods	1
has	1
ordained	1
that	1
even	1
death	1
has	1
some	1
antidote	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
terrors	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
where	1
any	1
shock	1
may	1
prove	1
fatal	1
matters	1
are	1
so	1
ordered	1
that	1
from	1
some	1
cause	1
or	1
other	1
the	1
things	1
not	1
personal	1
even	1
the	1
terrible	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
attached	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
reach	1
her	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
way	1
dame	1
nature	1
gathers	1
round	1
a	1
foreign	1
body	1
an	1
envelope	1
of	1
some	1
insensitive	1
tissue	1
which	1
can	1
protect	1
from	1
evil	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
otherwise	1
harm	1
by	1
contact	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
an	1
ordered	1
selfishness	1
then	1
we	1
should	1
pause	1
before	1
we	1
condemn	1
any	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
vice	1
of	1
egoism	1
for	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
deeper	1
roots	1
for	1
its	1
causes	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
knowledge	1
of	1
i	1
used	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
phase	1
of	1
spiritual	1
pathology	1
and	1
laid	1
down	1
a	1
rule	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
lucy	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
illness	1
more	1
than	1
was	1
absolutely	1
required	1
she	1
assented	1
readily	1
so	1
readily	1
that	1
i	1
saw	1
again	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
nature	1
fighting	1
for	1
life	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
shown	1
up	1
to	1
lucys	1
room	1
if	1
i	1
was	1
shocked	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
yesterday	1
i	1
was	1
horrified	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
today	1
she	1
was	1
ghastly	1
chalkily	1
pale	1
the	1
red	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
even	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
gums	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
stood	1
out	1
prominently	1
her	1
breathing	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
see	1
or	1
hear	1
van	1
helsings	1
face	1
grew	1
set	1
as	1
marble	1
and	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
converged	1
till	1
they	1
almost	1
touched	1
over	1
his	1
nose	1
lucy	1
lay	1
motionless	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
strength	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
silent	1
then	1
van	1
helsing	1
beckoned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
gently	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
instant	1
we	1
had	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
door	1
which	1
was	1
open	1
then	1
he	1
pulled	1
me	1
quickly	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
my	1
god	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
is	1
dreadful	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
she	1
will	1
die	1
for	1
sheer	1
want	1
of	1
blood	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
hearts	1
action	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
there	1

bag	1

went	1
downstairs	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
halldoor	1
when	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
hall	1
the	1
maid	1
had	1
just	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
arthur	1
was	1
stepping	1
quickly	1
in	1
he	1
rushed	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
saying	1
in	1
an	1
eager	1
whisper	1
jack	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
i	1
read	1
between	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1

been	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1

professors	1
eye	1

lit	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
angry	1
at	1
my	1
interruption	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
but	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
in	1
his	1
stalwart	1
proportions	1
and	1
recognised	1
the	1
strong	1
young	1
manhood	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
emanate	1
from	1
him	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
gravely	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1

a	1
strongly	1
humourous	1
side	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
from	1
old	1
knowledge	1
detect	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
its	1
origin	1
in	1
his	1
answer	1
my	1
young	1
sir	1

the	1

a	1
kindly	1
way	1
young	1

my	1

and	1
i	1

consulted	1
and	1
we	1

about	1
to	1
perform	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
transfusion	1
of	1

to	1
transfer	1
from	1
full	1

the	1

veins	1
which	1

and	1
strong	1
than	1
me	1
here	1
arthur	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
wrung	1
it	1
hard	1
in	1
silence	1
but	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
more	1
good	1
than	1
us	1

who	1
toil	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1

our	1

are	1
not	1
so	1
calm	1
and	1
our	1
blood	1
not	1
so	1
bright	1
than	1
yours	1
arthur	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
gladly	1
i	1
would	1
die	1
for	1
her	1
you	1
would	1

he	1
stopped	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
choke	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
good	1
boy	1
said	1
van	1

in	1
the	1

you	1

now	1
and	1
be	1
silent	1
you	1
shall	1
kiss	1
her	1
once	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
but	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
leave	1
at	1
my	1
sign	1
say	1
no	1

to	1
madame	1
you	1

with	1
her	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
shock	1
any	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
one	1
come	1
we	1
all	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
lucys	1
room	1
arthur	1
by	1
direction	1
remained	1
outside	1
lucy	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
us	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
effort	1
her	1
eyes	1
spoke	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
van	1
helsing	1
took	1
some	1
things	1
from	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
then	1
he	1
mixed	1
a	1
narcotic	1
and	1
coming	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
said	1
cheerily	1
now	1
little	1
miss	1
here	1
is	1
your	1
medicine	1
drink	1
it	1
off	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
child	1
see	1
i	1
lift	1
you	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
swallow	1
is	1
easy	1
yes	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
effort	1
with	1
success	1
it	1
astonished	1
me	1
how	1
long	1
the	1
drug	1
took	1
to	1
act	1
this	1
in	1
fact	1
marked	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
weakness	1
the	1
time	1
seemed	1
endless	1
until	1
sleep	1
began	1
to	1
flicker	1
in	1
her	1
eyelids	1
at	1
last	1
however	1
the	1
narcotic	1
began	1
to	1
manifest	1
its	1
potency	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
was	1
satisfied	1
he	1
called	1
arthur	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
strip	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
then	1
he	1
added	1
you	1
may	1
take	1
that	1
one	1
little	1
kiss	1
whiles	1
i	1
bring	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
friend	1
john	1
help	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
looked	1
whilst	1
he	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
van	1
helsing	1
turning	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
young	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
blood	1
so	1
pure	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
defibrinate	1
it	1
then	1
with	1
swiftness	1
but	1
with	1
absolute	1
method	1
van	1
helsing	1
performed	1
the	1
operation	1
as	1
the	1
transfusion	1
went	1
on	1
something	1
like	1
life	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
poor	1
lucys	1
cheeks	1
and	1
through	1
arthurs	1
growing	1
pallor	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
absolutely	1
to	1
shine	1
after	1
a	1
bit	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
was	1
telling	1
on	1
arthur	1
strong	1
man	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
strain	1
lucys	1
system	1
must	1
have	1
undergone	1
that	1
what	1
weakened	1
arthur	1
only	1
partially	1
restored	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
professors	1
face	1
was	1
set	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
watch	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
patient	1
and	1
now	1
on	1
arthur	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
beat	1
presently	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
voice	1
do	1
not	1
stir	1
an	1
instant	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
you	1
attend	1
him	1
i	1
will	1
look	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
over	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
arthur	1
was	1
weakened	1
i	1
dressed	1
the	1
wound	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
away	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
spoke	1
without	1
turning	1
round	1
the	1
man	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
brave	1
lover	1
i	1
think	1
deserve	1
another	1
kiss	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
presently	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
finished	1
his	1
operation	1
he	1
adjusted	1
the	1
pillow	1
to	1
the	1
patients	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
narrow	1
black	1
velvet	1
band	1
which	1
she	1
seems	1
always	1
to	1
wear	1
round	1
her	1
throat	1
buckled	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
diamond	1
buckle	1
which	1
her	1
lover	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
was	1
dragged	1
a	1
little	1
up	1
and	1
showed	1
a	1
red	1
mark	1
on	1
her	1
throat	1
arthur	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
deep	1
hiss	1
of	1
indrawn	1
breath	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
van	1
helsings	1
ways	1
of	1
betraying	1
emotion	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
but	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
saying	1
now	1
take	1
down	1
our	1
brave	1
young	1
lover	1
give	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
port	1
wine	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
lie	1
down	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
must	1
then	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
rest	1
sleep	1
much	1
and	1
eat	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
recruited	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
so	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
love	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
stay	1
here	1
hold	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
sir	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
anxious	1
of	1
result	1
then	1
bring	1
it	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
ways	1
the	1
operation	1
is	1
successful	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
her	1
life	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
rest	1
easy	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
is	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
well	1
she	1
shall	1
love	1
you	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
goodbye	1
when	1
arthur	1
had	1
gone	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
lucy	1
was	1
sleeping	1
gently	1
but	1
her	1
breathing	1
was	1
stronger	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
counterpane	1
move	1
as	1
her	1
breast	1
heaved	1
by	1
the	1
bedside	1
sat	1
van	1
helsing	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
intently	1
the	1
velvet	1
band	1
again	1
covered	1
the	1
red	1
mark	1
i	1
asked	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that	1
mark	1
on	1
her	1
throat	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
examined	1
it	1
yet	1
i	1
answered	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
there	1
proceeded	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
band	1
just	1
over	1
the	1
external	1
jugular	1
vein	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
punctures	1
not	1
large	1
but	1
not	1
wholesomelooking	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
disease	1
but	1
the	1
edges	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
wornlooking	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
some	1
trituration	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
wound	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
that	1
manifest	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
but	1
i	1
abandoned	1
the	1
idea	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
formed	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1

scarlet	1
with	1
the	1

which	1
the	1
girl	1
must	1
have	1
lost	1
to	1
leave	1

had	1
been	1
before	1
the	1
operation	1
her	1
spirits	1
even	1
were	1
good	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
happy	1
vivacity	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
evidences	1
of	1
the	1
absolute	1
prostration	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
undergone	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
that	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
directed	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
almost	1
poohpoohed	1
the	1
idea	1
pointing	1
out	1
her	1
daughters	1
renewed	1
strength	1
and	1
excellent	1
spirits	1
i	1
was	1
firm	1
however	1
and	1
made	1
preparations	1
for	1
my	1
long	1
vigil	1
when	1
her	1
maid	1
had	1
prepared	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
having	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
had	1
supper	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
the	1
bedside	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
make	1
objection	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
gratefully	1
whenever	1
i	1
caught	1
her	1
eye	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
spell	1
she	1
seemed	1
sinking	1
off	1
to	1
sleep	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
seemed	1
to	1
pull	1
herself	1
together	1
and	1
shook	1
it	1
off	1
this	1
was	1
repeated	1
several	1
times	1
with	1
greater	1
effort	1
and	1
with	1
shorter	1
pauses	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
moved	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
sleep	1
so	1
i	1
tackled	1
the	1
subject	1
at	1
once	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
no	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
why	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
boon	1
we	1
all	1
crave	1
for	1
ah	1
not	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
like	1
me	1
if	1
sleep	1
was	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
presage	1
of	1
horror	1
a	1
presage	1
of	1
horror	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
oh	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
terrible	1
all	1
this	1
weakness	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
sleep	1
until	1
i	1
dread	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
girl	1
you	1
may	1
sleep	1
tonight	1
i	1
am	1
here	1
watching	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
promise	1
that	1
nothing	1
will	1
happen	1
ah	1
i	1
can	1
trust	1
you	1
i	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
see	1
any	1
evidence	1
of	1
bad	1
dreams	1
i	1
will	1
wake	1
you	1
at	1
once	1
you	1
will	1
oh	1
will	1
you	1
really	1
how	1
good	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
i	1
will	1
sleep	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
asleep	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
i	1
watched	1
by	1
her	1
she	1
never	1
stirred	1
but	1
slept	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
tranquil	1
lifegiving	1
healthgiving	1
sleep	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
slightly	1
parted	1
and	1
her	1
breast	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
with	1
the	1
regularity	1
of	1
a	1
pendulum	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
no	1
bad	1
dreams	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
disturb	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
morning	1
her	1
maid	1
came	1
and	1
i	1
left	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
care	1
and	1
took	1
myself	1
back	1
home	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
anxious	1
about	1
many	1
things	1
i	1
sent	1
a	1
short	1
wire	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
to	1
arthur	1
telling	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
excellent	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
operation	1
my	1
own	1
work	1
with	1
its	1
manifold	1
arrears	1
took	1
me	1
all	1
day	1
to	1
clear	1
off	1
it	1
was	1
dark	1
when	1

able	1
to	1
inquire	1
about	1
my	1
zoophagous	1
patient	1
the	1
report	1
was	1
good	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
quiet	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
a	1
telegram	1
came	1
from	1
van	1
helsing	1
at	1
amsterdam	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
dinner	1

it	1
might	1

hardly	1
had	1
a	1
wink	1
of	1
sleep	1
and	1
my	1
brain	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
numbness	1
which	1
marks	1
cerebral	1
exhaustion	1
lucy	1
was	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
cheerful	1

i	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
professors	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
started	1
awake	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
that	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
learn	1
in	1
an	1
asylum	1
at	1
any	1

and	1
how	1
is	1
our	1
patient	1
well	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
her	1
or	1
rather	1
when	1
she	1
left	1
me	1
i	1
answered	1
come	1
let	1
us	1
see	1

said	1
and	1
together	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
blind	1
was	1
down	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
over	1

it	1
gently	1
whilst	1
van	1
helsing	1
stepped	1
with	1
his	1
soft	1
catlike	1
tread	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
as	1
i	1
raised	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
sunlight	1
flooded	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
professors	1
low	1
hiss	1
of	1
inspiration	1
and	1
knowing	1
its	1
rarity	1
a	1
deadly	1
fear	1
shot	1
through	1
my	1
heart	1
as	1
i	1
passed	1
over	1
he	1
moved	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
exclamation	1
of	1
horror	1
gott	1
in	1
himmel	1
needed	1
no	1
enforcement	1
from	1
his	1
agonised	1
face	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
his	1
iron	1
face	1
was	1
drawn	1
and	1
ashen	1
white	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
knees	1
begin	1
to	1
tremble	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
seemingly	1
in	1
a	1
swoon	1
lay	1
poor	1

more	1
horribly	1
white	1
and	1
wanlooking	1
than	1
ever	1
even	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
the	1
gums	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
shrunken	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
teeth	1
as	1
we	1
sometimes	1
see	1
in	1
a	1
corpse	1
after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
illness	1
van	1
helsing	1
raised	1
his	1
foot	1
to	1
stamp	1
in	1
anger	1
but	1
the	1
instinct	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
long	1
years	1
of	1
habit	1
stood	1
to	1
him	1

he	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
again	1
softly	1
quick	1
he	1
said	1
bring	1
the	1
brandy	1
i	1
flew	1
to	1
the	1
diningroom	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
decanter	1
he	1
wetted	1
the	1
poor	1
white	1
lips	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
together	1
we	1
rubbed	1
palm	1
and	1
wrist	1
and	1
heart	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
of	1
agonising	1
suspense	1
said	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
it	1
beats	1
though	1
but	1
feebly	1
all	1
our	1
work	1
is	1
undone	1
we	1
must	1

i	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
my	1
coat	1

rolled	1
up	1
my	1

there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
an	1
opiate	1
just	1
at	1

no	1

of	1
one	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
a	1
moments	1
delay	1
we	1
began	1
the	1
operation	1
after	1
a	1
time	1

up	1
a	1
warning	1

he	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
with	1
growing	1
strength	1
she	1
may	1
wake	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
make	1

he	1
proceeded	1
then	1
swiftly	1
and	1
deftly	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
intent	1
the	1
effect	1
on	1
lucy	1
was	1
not	1
bad	1
for	1
the	1
faint	1
seemed	1
to	1
merge	1
subtly	1
into	1
the	1
narcotic	1
sleep	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
personal	1
pride	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
faint	1
tinge	1
of	1
colour	1
steal	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
pallid	1
cheeks	1
and	1
lips	1

his	1
own	1

drawn	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
veins	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loves	1
the	1
professor	1
watched	1
me	1
critically	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
he	1
said	1
already	1
i	1
remonstrated	1
you	1
took	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
from	1
art	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
smiled	1
a	1
sad	1
sort	1
of	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
replied	1
he	1
is	1
her	1
lover	1
her	1
fiance	1
you	1
have	1
work	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
others	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
will	1
suffice	1
when	1
we	1
stopped	1
the	1
operation	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
lucy	1
whilst	1
i	1
applied	1
digital	1
pressure	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
incision	1
i	1
laid	1
down	1
whilst	1
i	1
waited	1
his	1
leisure	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
faint	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
sick	1
byandby	1
he	1
bound	1
up	1
my	1
wound	1
and	1
sent	1
me	1
downstairs	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
for	1
myself	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
came	1
after	1
me	1
and	1
half	1
whispered	1
mind	1
nothing	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
this	1
if	1
our	1
young	1
lover	1
should	1
turn	1
up	1
unexpected	1
as	1
before	1
no	1
word	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
frighten	1
him	1
and	1
enjealous	1
him	1
too	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
none	1
so	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
carefully	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
lie	1
on	1
your	1
sofa	1
and	1
rest	1
awhile	1
then	1
have	1
much	1
breakfast	1
and	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
followed	1
out	1
his	1
orders	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
how	1
right	1
and	1
wise	1
they	1
were	1
i	1
had	1
done	1
my	1
part	1
and	1
now	1
my	1
next	1
duty	1
was	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
my	1
strength	1
i	1
felt	1
very	1
weak	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
weakness	1
lost	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
amazement	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
i	1
fell	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
however	1
wondering	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
how	1
lucy	1
had	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
retrograde	1
movement	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
drained	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
blood	1
with	1
no	1
sign	1
anywhere	1
to	1
show	1
for	1
it	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
continued	1
my	1
wonder	1
in	1
my	1
dreams	1
for	1
sleeping	1
and	1
waking	1
my	1
thoughts	1
always	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
punctures	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
the	1
ragged	1
exhausted	1
appearance	1
of	1
their	1
edges	1
tiny	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
lucy	1
slept	1
well	1
into	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
woke	1
she	1
was	1
fairly	1
well	1
and	1
strong	1
though	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
leaving	1
me	1
in	1
charge	1
with	1
strict	1
injunctions	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
asking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
telegraph	1
office	1
lucy	1
chatted	1
with	1
me	1
freely	1
and	1
seemed	1
quite	1
unconscious	1
that	1
anything	1
had	1
happened	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
amused	1
and	1
interested	1
when	1
her	1
mother	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
notice	1
any	1
change	1
whatever	1
but	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
gratefully	1
we	1
owe	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
dr	1
seward	1
for	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
but	1
you	1
really	1
must	1
now	1
take	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
overwork	1
yourself	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
pale	1
yourself	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
nurse	1
and	1
look	1
after	1
you	1
a	1
bit	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
lucy	1
turned	1
crimson	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
momentarily	1
for	1
her	1
poor	1
wasted	1
veins	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
for	1
long	1
such	1
an	1
unwonted	1
drain	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
the	1
reaction	1
came	1
in	1
excessive	1
pallor	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
imploring	1
eyes	1
on	1
me	1
i	1
smiled	1
and	1
nodded	1
and	1
laid	1
my	1
finger	1
on	1
my	1
lips	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
she	1
sank	1
back	1
amid	1
her	1
pillows	1
van	1
helsing	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
and	1
presently	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
you	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
eat	1
much	1
and	1
drink	1
enough	1
make	1
yourself	1
strong	1
i	1
stay	1
here	1
tonight	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
little	1
miss	1
myself	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
watch	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
none	1
other	1
to	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
grave	1
reasons	1
no	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
them	1
think	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
think	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
notprobable	1
goodnight	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
they	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
might	1
not	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
miss	1
lucy	1
they	1
implored	1
me	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
dr	1
van	1
helsings	1
wish	1
that	1
either	1
he	1
or	1
i	1
should	1
sit	1
up	1
they	1
asked	1
me	1
quite	1
piteously	1
to	1
intercede	1
with	1
the	1
foreign	1
gentleman	1
i	1
was	1
much	1
touched	1
by	1
their	1
kindness	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
weak	1
at	1
present	1
and	1
perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
lucys	1
account	1
that	1
their	1
devotion	1
was	1
manifested	1
for	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
have	1
i	1
seen	1
similar	1
instances	1
of	1
womans	1
kindness	1
i	1
got	1
back	1
here	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
late	1
dinner	1
went	1
my	1
rounds	1
all	1
well	1
and	1
set	1
this	1
down	1
whilst	1
waiting	1
for	1

it	1

coming	1

september	1
this	1
afternoon	1
i	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
hillingham	1
found	1
van	1
helsing	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits	1
and	1
lucy	1
much	1
better	1
shortly	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
arrived	1
a	1
big	1
parcel	1
from	1
abroad	1
came	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
he	1
opened	1
it	1
with	1
much	1
impressment	1
assumed	1
of	1
course	1
and	1
showed	1
a	1
great	1
bundle	1
of	1
white	1
flowers	1
these	1
are	1
for	1
you	1
miss	1
lucy	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
me	1
oh	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
yes	1
my	1
dear	1
but	1

medicines	1
here	1
lucy	1
made	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
nay	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
a	1
decoction	1
or	1
in	1
nauseous	1
form	1
so	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
snub	1
that	1
so	1
charming	1
nose	1
or	1
i	1
shall	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
arthur	1
what	1
woes	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
endure	1
in	1
seeing	1
so	1
much	1
beauty	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
loves	1
so	1
much	1
distort	1

the	1
so	1
nice	1
nose	1
all	1
straight	1
again	1
this	1
is	1
medicinal	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
i	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
your	1
window	1
i	1
make	1
pretty	1
wreath	1
and	1
hang	1
him	1
round	1
your	1
neck	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
sleep	1
well	1
oh	1
yes	1
they	1
like	1
the	1
lotus	1
flower	1
make	1
your	1
trouble	1
forgotten	1
it	1
smell	1
so	1
like	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
lethe	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
fountain	1
of	1
youth	1
that	1
the	1
conquistodores	1
sought	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
floridas	1
and	1
find	1
him	1
all	1
too	1
late	1
whilst	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
lucy	1
had	1
been	1
examining	1
the	1
flowers	1
and	1
smelling	1
them	1
now	1
she	1
threw	1
them	1
down	1
saying	1
with	1
halflaughter	1
and	1
halfdisgust	1
oh	1
professor	1
i	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
only	1
putting	1
up	1
a	1
joke	1
on	1
me	1
why	1
these	1
flowers	1
are	1
only	1
common	1
garlic	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
van	1
helsing	1

with	1
all	1
his	1
sterness	1
his	1
iron	1
jaw	1
set	1
and	1
his	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
meeting	1
no	1
trifling	1
with	1
me	1

never	1

for	1
your	1

there	1

much	1
virtue	1
to	1
you	1

those	1
so	1
common	1
flowers	1

so	1
inquisitive	1
questions	1

obey	1
and	1
silence	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
obedience	1

obedience	1
is	1
to	1
bring	1

into	1
the	1
room	1
taking	1
the	1
flowers	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
professors	1
actions	1
were	1
certainly	1
odd	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
pharmacopoeia	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
first	1
he	1
fastened	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
latched	1
them	1
securely	1
next	1
taking	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
flowers	1
he	1
rubbed	1
them	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
sashes	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
ensure	1
that	1
every	1
whiff	1
of	1
air	1
that	1
might	1
get	1
in	1
would	1
be	1
laden	1
with	1
the	1
garlic	1
smell	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
wisp	1
he	1
rubbed	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
jamb	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
above	1
below	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
fireplace	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
grotesque	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
presently	1
i	1
said	1
well	1
professor	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
always	1
have	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
do	1
but	1
this	1
certainly	1
puzzles	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
sceptic	1
here	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
working	1
some	1
spell	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
perhaps	1
i	1
am	1
he	1
answered	1
quietly	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
wreath	1
which	1
lucy	1
was	1
to	1
wear	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
we	1
then	1
waited	1
whilst	1
lucy	1
made	1
her	1
toilet	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
bed	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
himself	1
fixed	1
the	1
wreath	1
of	1
garlic	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
were	1
take	1
care	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
disturb	1
it	1
and	1
even	1

about	1

he	1
positively	1

so	1
often	1
of	1
late	1
the	1

he	1
always	1

now	1
let	1
all	1

down	1
exactly	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
hillingham	1
at	1
eight	1
oclock	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
morning	1
the	1
bright	1
sunshine	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fresh	1
feeling	1
of	1
early	1
autumn	1
seemed	1
liked	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
natures	1
annual	1
work	1
the	1
leaves	1
were	1
turning	1
to	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
beautiful	1
colours	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun	1
to	1
drop	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
when	1
we	1
entered	1
we	1
met	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
room	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
an	1
early	1
riser	1
she	1
greeted	1
us	1
warmly	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
lucy	1
is	1
better	1
the	1
dear	1
child	1
is	1
still	1
asleep	1
i	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
lest	1
i	1
should	1
disturb	1
her	1
the	1
professor	1
smiled	1
and	1
looked	1
quite	1
jubilant	1
he	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands	1
together	1
and	1
said	1
aha	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
had	1
diagnosed	1
the	1
case	1
my	1
treatment	1
is	1
working	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
answered	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
credit	1
to	1
yourself	1
doctor	1
lucys	1
state	1
this	1
morning	1
is	1
due	1
in	1
part	1
to	1
me	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
maam	1
asked	1
the	1
professor	1
well	1
i	1
was	1
anxious	1
about	1
the	1
dear	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
she	1
was	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
so	1
soundly	1
that	1
even	1
my	1
coming	1
did	1
not	1
wake	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
awfully	1
stuffy	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
horrible	1
strongsmelling	1
flowers	1
about	1
everywhere	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
actually	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
them	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
heavy	1
odour	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
dear	1
child	1
in	1
her	1
weak	1
state	1
so	1
i	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
away	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
fresh	1
air	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
moved	1
off	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
where	1
she	1
usually	1
breakfasted	1
early	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
i	1
watched	1
the	1
professors	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
turn	1
ashen	1
grey	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
retain	1
his	1
selfcommand	1
whilst	1
the	1
poor	1
lady	1
was	1
present	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
state	1
and	1
how	1
mischievous	1
a	1
shock	1
would	1
be	1
he	1
actually	1
smiled	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
had	1
disappeared	1
he	1
pulled	1
me	1
suddenly	1
and	1
forcibly	1
into	1
the	1
diningroom	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
i	1
saw	1
van	1
helsing	1
break	1
down	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hands	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mute	1
despair	1
and	1
then	1
beat	1
his	1
palms	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
helpless	1
way	1
finally	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
with	1
loud	1
dry	1
sobs	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
racking	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
then	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
arms	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
appealing	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
god	1
god	1
god	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
done	1
what	1
has	1
this	1
poor	1
thing	1
done	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
sore	1
beset	1
is	1
there	1
fate	1
amongst	1
us	1
still	1
sent	1
down	1
form	1
the	1
pagan	1
world	1
of	1
old	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
way	1
this	1
poor	1
mother	1
all	1
unknowing	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
as	1
she	1
think	1
does	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
lose	1
her	1
daughter	1
body	1
and	1
soul	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
even	1
warn	1
her	1
or	1
she	1
die	1
and	1
then	1
both	1
die	1
oh	1
how	1
we	1
are	1
beset	1
how	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
against	1
us	1
suddenly	1
he	1
jumped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
come	1
we	1
must	1
see	1
and	1
act	1
devils	1
or	1
no	1
devils	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
matters	1
not	1
we	1
fight	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
halldoor	1
for	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
together	1
we	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
lucys	1
room	1
once	1
again	1
i	1
drew	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
whilst	1
van	1
helsing	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
bed	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
start	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
awful	1
waxen	1
pallor	1
as	1
before	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stern	1
sadness	1
and	1
infinite	1
pity	1
as	1
i	1
expected	1
he	1
murmured	1
with	1
that	1
hissing	1
inspiration	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
meant	1
so	1
much	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
the	1
instruments	1
for	1
yet	1
another	1
operation	1
of	1
transfusion	1
of	1
blood	1
i	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
recognised	1
the	1
necessity	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
coat	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
warning	1
hand	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
today	1
you	1
must	1
operate	1
i	1
shall	1
provide	1
you	1
are	1
weakened	1
already	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
took	1
off	1

watched	1
whilst	1
van	1
helsing	1
recruited	1
himself	1
and	1
rested	1
presently	1
he	1
took	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
telling	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
remove	1
anything	1
from	1
lucys	1
room	1
without	1
consulting	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
flowers	1
were	1
of	1
medicinal	1
value	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
breathing	1

their	1
odour	1
was	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1

then	1
he	1
took	1
over	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
himself	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
watch	1
this	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
and	1

seemingly	1
not	1

what	1

i	1

wonder	1
if	1
my	1

of	1
life	1
amongst	1

i	1
am	1
getting	1
so	1
strong	1
again	1
that	1
i	1
hardly	1
know	1
myself	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
some	1
long	1
nightmare	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
awakened	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
beautiful	1
sunshine	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
around	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
dim	1
halfremembrance	1
of	1
long	1
anxious	1
times	1
of	1
waiting	1
and	1
fearing	1
darkness	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
hope	1
to	1
make	1
present	1
distress	1
more	1
poignant	1
and	1
then	1
long	1
spell	1
of	1
oblivion	1
and	1
the	1
rising	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
as	1
a	1

noises	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
frighten	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
wits	1
the	1
flapping	1
against	1

for	1
if	1
he	1

e	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
missis	1
when	1
e	1
got	1
ome	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
wolf	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
ahuntin	1
of	1
the	1
park	1
for	1
bersicker	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
seein	1
anything	1
my	1
own	1
belief	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
armony	1
ad	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
ead	1
now	1
mr	1
bilder	1
can	1
you	1
account	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
wolf	1
well	1
sir	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
suspicious	1
sort	1
of	1
modesty	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
can	1
but	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
as	1
ow	1
youd	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
theory	1
certainly	1
i	1
shall	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you	1
who	1
knows	1
the	1
animals	1
from	1
experience	1
cant	1
hazard	1
a	1
good	1
guess	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
who	1
is	1
even	1
to	1
try	1
well	1
then	1
sir	1
i	1
accounts	1
for	1
it	1
this	1
way	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
ere	1
wolf	1
escaped	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
hearty	1
way	1
that	1
both	1
thomas	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
joke	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
service	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
explanation	1
was	1
simply	1
an	1
elaborate	1
sell	1
i	1
couldnt	1
cope	1
in	1
badinage	1
with	1
the	1
worthy	1
thomas	1
but	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
knew	1
a	1
surer	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
now	1
mr	1
bilder	1
well	1
consider	1
that	1
first	1
halfsovereign	1

at	1
me	1

opened	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
unnecessary	1
proceeding	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
wild	1
animal	1
never	1
looks	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
when	1
some	1
obstacle	1
of	1
pronounced	1
durability	1
is	1
between	1
us	1
a	1
personal	1
experience	1
has	1
intensified	1
rather	1
than	1
diminished	1
that	1
idea	1
after	1
all	1
however	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
custom	1
for	1
neither	1

his	1

thought	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
the	1

than	1
i	1
should	1
of	1
a	1

the	1
whole	1

was	1
an	1
unutterable	1
mixture	1
of	1
comedy	1
and	1
pathos	1
the	1
wicked	1
wolf	1
that	1
for	1
half	1
a	1

posting	1
up	1
my	1

fallen	1
sadly	1
into	1
arrear	1
suddenly	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
burst	1
open	1
and	1
in	1
rushed	1
my	1
patient	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
distorted	1
with	1
passion	1
i	1
was	1
thunderstruck	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1

straight	1
at	1
me	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
dinnerknife	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
dangerous	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
table	1
between	1
us	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
quick	1
and	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me	1
however	1
for	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
my	1
balance	1
he	1
had	1
struck	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
cut	1
my	1
left	1
wrist	1
rather	1
severely	1
before	1

could	1
strike	1
again	1
however	1
i	1
got	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sprawling	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
my	1
wrist	1
bled	1
freely	1

quite	1

intent	1
on	1
further	1
effort	1
and	1
occupied	1
myself	1
binding	1
up	1
my	1
wrist	1
keeping	1
a	1
wary	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
prostrate	1
figure	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
attendants	1
rushed	1
in	1
and	1
we	1
turned	1
our	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
employment	1
positively	1
sickened	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
belly	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
licking	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
my	1
wounded	1
wrist	1
he	1
was	1
easily	1
secured	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
attendants	1
quite	1
placidly	1
simply	1
repeating	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
the	1

the	1
arrival	1
of	1

telegram	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
dismay	1
a	1
whole	1
night	1
lost	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
by	1
bitter	1
experience	1
what	1
may	1
happen	1
in	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
but	1
what	1
may	1
have	1
happened	1
surely	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
horrible	1
doom	1
hanging	1
over	1
us	1
that	1
every	1
possible	1
accident	1
should	1
thwart	1
us	1

we	1
try	1

night	1
i	1
write	1
this	1

that	1

by	1
any	1

get	1
into	1
trouble	1
through	1
me	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
exact	1
record	1
of	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
tonight	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
am	1
dying	1
of	1
weakness	1
and	1
have	1
barely	1
strength	1
to	1
write	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
i	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
doing	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
as	1
usual	1
taking	1
care	1
that	1
the	1
flowers	1
were	1
placed	1
as	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
directed	1
and	1
soon	1
fell	1
asleep	1
i	1
was	1
waked	1
by	1
the	1
flapping	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
had	1
begun	1
after	1
that	1
sleepwalking	1
on	1
the	1
cliff	1
at	1
whitby	1
when	1
mina	1
saved	1
me	1
and	1
which	1
now	1
i	1
know	1
so	1
well	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
wish	1
that	1
dr	1
seward	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
as	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
old	1
fear	1
of	1
sleep	1
and	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
keep	1
awake	1
perversely	1
sleep	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
come	1
then	1
when	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
i	1
opened	1
my	1
door	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
is	1
there	1
anybody	1
there	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
wake	1
mother	1
and	1
so	1
closed	1
my	1
door	1
again	1
then	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
howl	1
like	1
a	1
dogs	1
but	1
more	1
fierce	1
and	1
deeper	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
except	1
a	1
big	1
bat	1
which	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
buffeting	1
its	1
wings	1
against	1
the	1
window	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
bed	1
again	1
but	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
presently	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
mother	1
looked	1
in	1
seeing	1
by	1
my	1
moving	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
by	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
even	1
more	1
sweetly	1
and	1
softly	1
than	1
her	1
wont	1
i	1
was	1
uneasy	1
about	1
you	1
darling	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
right	1
i	1
feared	1
she	1
might	1
catch	1
cold	1
sitting	1
there	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
sleep	1
with	1
me	1
so	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
bed	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
beside	1
me	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
off	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
stay	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
then	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
bed	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
there	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
and	1
i	1
in	1
hers	1
the	1
flapping	1
and	1
buffeting	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
frightened	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
pacify	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
quiet	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
her	1
poor	1
dear	1
heart	1
still	1
beating	1
terribly	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
low	1
howl	1
again	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
and	1
shortly	1
after	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
crash	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
broken	1
glass	1
was	1
hurled	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
the	1
window	1
blind	1
blew	1
back	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
rushed	1
in	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
aperture	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
panes	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
gaunt	1
grey	1
wolf	1
mother	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
fright	1
and	1
struggled	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sitting	1
posture	1
and	1
clutched	1
wildly	1
at	1
anything	1
that	1
would	1
help	1
her	1
amongst	1
other	1
things	1
she	1
clutched	1
the	1
wreath	1
of	1
flowers	1
that	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
insisted	1
on	1
my	1
wearing	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
tore	1
it	1
away	1
form	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
pointing	1
at	1
the	1
wolf	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
horrible	1
gurgling	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
then	1
she	1
fell	1
over	1
as	1
if	1
struck	1
with	1
lightning	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
hit	1
my	1
forehead	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
dizzy	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
all	1
round	1
seemed	1
to	1
spin	1
round	1
i	1
kept	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
but	1
the	1
wolf	1
drew	1
his	1
head	1
back	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
myriad	1
of	1
little	1
specks	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
blowing	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
window	1
and	1
wheeling	1
and	1
circling	1
round	1
like	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
dust	1
that	1
travellers	1
describe	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
simoom	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
stir	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
spell	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
dear	1
mothers	1
poor	1
body	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
cold	1
already	1
for	1
her	1
dear	1
heart	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
beat	1
weighed	1
me	1
down	1
and	1
i	1
remembered	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
time	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
long	1
but	1
very	1
very	1
awful	1
till	1
i	1
recovered	1
consciousness	1
again	1
somewhere	1
near	1
a	1
passing	1
bell	1
was	1
tolling	1
the	1
dogs	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
were	1
howling	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
shrubbery	1
seemingly	1
just	1
outside	1
a	1
nightingale	1
was	1
singing	1
i	1
was	1
dazed	1
and	1
stupid	1
with	1
pain	1
and	1
terror	1
and	1
weakness	1
but	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
nightingale	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
dead	1
mother	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
comfort	1
me	1
the	1
sounds	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
awakened	1
the	1
maids	1
too	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
their	1
bare	1
feet	1
pattering	1
outside	1
my	1
door	1
i	1
called	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
lay	1
over	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
they	1
screamed	1
out	1
the	1
wind	1
rushed	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
window	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
slammed	1
to	1
they	1
lifted	1
off	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
mother	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
covered	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
sheet	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
so	1
frightened	1
and	1
nervous	1
that	1
i	1
directed	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
diningroom	1
and	1
have	1
each	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
closed	1
again	1
the	1
maids	1
shrieked	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
diningroom	1
and	1
i	1
laid	1
what	1
flowers	1
i	1
had	1
on	1
my	1
dear	1
mothers	1
breast	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
there	1
i	1
remembered	1
what	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
didnt	1
like	1
to	1
remove	1
them	1
and	1
besides	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
now	1
i	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
the	1
maids	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
i	1
called	1
them	1
but	1
got	1
no	1
answer	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
diningroom	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
them	1
my	1
heart	1
sank	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
they	1
all	1
four	1
lay	1
helpless	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
the	1
decanter	1
of	1
sherry	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
half	1
full	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
queer	1
acrid	1
smell	1
about	1
i	1
was	1
suspicious	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
decanter	1
it	1
smelt	1
of	1
laudanum	1
and	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
sideboard	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
bottle	1
which	1
mothers	1
doctor	1
uses	1

september	1
i	1
drove	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
hillingham	1
and	1
arrived	1
early	1
keeping	1
my	1
cab	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
i	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
alone	1
i	1
knocked	1
gently	1
and	1
rang	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
disturb	1
lucy	1
or	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
hoped	1
to	1
only	1
bring	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
finding	1
no	1
response	1
i	1
knocked	1
and	1
rang	1
again	1
still	1
no	1
answer	1
i	1
cursed	1
the	1
laziness	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
lie	1
abed	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
hour	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
ten	1
oclock	1
and	1
so	1
rang	1
and	1
knocked	1
again	1
but	1
more	1
impatiently	1
but	1
still	1
without	1
response	1
hitherto	1
i	1
had	1
blamed	1
only	1
the	1
servants	1
but	1
now	1
a	1
terrible	1
fear	1
began	1
to	1
assail	1
me	1
was	1
this	1
desolation	1
but	1
another	1
link	1
in	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
doom	1
which	1
seemed	1
drawing	1
tight	1
around	1
us	1
was	1
it	1
indeed	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
death	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
too	1
late	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
minutes	1
even	1
seconds	1
of	1
delay	1
might	1
mean	1
hours	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
lucy	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
again	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
frightful	1
relapses	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
by	1
chance	1
an	1
entry	1
anywhere	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
ingress	1
every	1
window	1
and	1
door	1
was	1
fastened	1
and	1
locked	1
and	1
i	1
returned	1
baffled	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
rapid	1
pitpat	1
of	1
a	1
swiftly	1
driven	1
horses	1
feet	1
they	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
later	1
i	1
met	1
van	1
helsing	1
running	1
up	1
the	1
avenue	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1
gasped	1
out	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
and	1
just	1
arrived	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
are	1
we	1
too	1
late	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
get	1
my	1
telegram	1
i	1
answered	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
coherently	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
only	1
got	1
his	1
telegram	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
coming	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
hear	1
me	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
hat	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
solemnly	1
then	1
i	1
fear	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
late	1
gods	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
recuperative	1
energy	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
come	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
way	1
open	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
we	1
must	1
make	1
one	1
time	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
all	1
to	1
us	1
now	1
we	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
kitchen	1
window	1
the	1
professor	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
surgical	1
saw	1
from	1
his	1
case	1
and	1
handing	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
iron	1
bars	1
which	1
guarded	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
attacked	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
had	1
very	1
soon	1
cut	1
through	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
thin	1
knife	1
we	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
fastening	1
of	1
the	1
sashes	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
helped	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
and	1
followed	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
servants	1
rooms	1
which	1
were	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
we	1
tried	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
along	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
diningroom	1
dimly	1
lit	1
by	1
rays	1
of	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
shutters	1
found	1
four	1
servantwomen	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
think	1
them	1
dead	1
for	1
their	1
stertorous	1
breathing	1
and	1
the	1
acrid	1
smell	1
of	1
laudanum	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
left	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
condition	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
moved	1
away	1
he	1
said	1
we	1
can	1
attend	1
to	1
them	1
later	1
then	1
we	1
ascended	1
to	1
lucys	1
room	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
or	1
two	1
we	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
listen	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sound	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
with	1
white	1
faces	1
and	1
trembling	1
hands	1
we	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
gently	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
describe	1
what	1
we	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
lay	1
two	1
women	1
lucy	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
the	1
latter	1
lay	1
farthest	1
in	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
sheet	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
blown	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
draught	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
window	1
showing	1
the	1
drawn	1
white	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
terror	1
fixed	1
upon	1
it	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
lay	1
lucy	1
with	1
face	1
white	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
drawn	1
the	1
flowers	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
we	1
found	1
upon	1
her	1
mothers	1
bosom	1
and	1
her	1
throat	1
was	1
bare	1
showing	1
the	1
two	1
little	1
wounds	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
noticed	1
before	1
but	1
looking	1
horribly	1
white	1
and	1
mangled	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
professor	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
bed	1
his	1
head	1
almost	1
touching	1
poor	1
lucys	1
breast	1
then	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
quick	1
turn	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
listens	1
and	1
leaping	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
too	1
late	1
quick	1
quick	1
bring	1
the	1
brandy	1
i	1
flew	1
downstairs	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
it	1
taking	1
care	1
to	1
smell	1
and	1
taste	1
it	1
lest	1
it	1
too	1
were	1
drugged	1
like	1
the	1
decanter	1
of	1
sherry	1
which	1
i	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
maids	1
were	1
still	1
breathing	1
but	1
more	1
restlessly	1
and	1
i	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
narcotic	1
was	1
wearing	1
off	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
but	1
returned	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
he	1
rubbed	1
the	1
brandy	1
as	1
on	1
another	1
occasion	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
gums	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
wrists	1
and	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
her	1
hands	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
this	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
you	1
go	1
wake	1
those	1
maids	1
flick	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
wet	1
towel	1
and	1
flick	1
them	1
hard	1
make	1
them	1
get	1
heat	1
and	1
fire	1
and	1
a	1
warm	1
bath	1
this	1
poor	1
soul	1
is	1
nearly	1
as	1
cold	1
as	1
that	1
beside	1
her	1
she	1
will	1
need	1
be	1
heated	1
before	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
more	1
i	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
found	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
waking	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
the	1
fourth	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
drug	1
had	1
evidently	1
affected	1
her	1
more	1
strongly	1
so	1
i	1
lifted	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
sleep	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
dazed	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
as	1
remembrance	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
cried	1
and	1
sobbed	1
in	1
a	1
hysterical	1
manner	1
i	1
was	1
stern	1
with	1
them	1
however	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
talk	1
i	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
one	1
life	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
lose	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
delayed	1
they	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
miss	1
lucy	1
so	1
sobbing	1
and	1
crying	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
their	1
way	1
half	1
clad	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
prepared	1
fire	1
and	1
water	1
fortunately	1
the	1
kitchen	1
and	1
boiler	1
fires	1
were	1
still	1
alive	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
lack	1
of	1
hot	1
water	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
bath	1
and	1
carried	1
lucy	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
it	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
busy	1
chafing	1
her	1
limbs	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
halldoor	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
ran	1
off	1
hurried	1
on	1
some	1
more	1
clothes	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
then	1
she	1
returned	1
and	1
whispered	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
mr	1
holmwood	1
i	1
bade	1
her	1
simply	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
one	1
now	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
message	1
and	1
engrossed	1
with	1
our	1
work	1
i	1
clean	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
him	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
experience	1
the	1
professor	1
work	1
in	1
such	1
deadly	1
earnest	1
i	1
knew	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
standup	1
fight	1
with	1
death	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
sternest	1
look	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
wear	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
all	1
i	1
would	1
stop	1
here	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
fade	1
away	1
into	1
peace	1
for	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
life	1
over	1
her	1
horizon	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
work	1
with	1
if	1
possible	1
renewed	1
and	1
more	1
frenzied	1
vigour	1
presently	1
we	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious	1
that	1
the	1
heat	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
effect	1
lucys	1
heart	1
beat	1
a	1
trine	1
more	1
audibly	1
to	1
the	1
stethoscope	1
and	1
her	1
lungs	1
had	1
a	1
perceptible	1
movement	1
van	1
helsings	1
face	1
almost	1
beamed	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
lifted	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
bath	1
and	1
rolled	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
hot	1
sheet	1
to	1
dry	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
first	1
gain	1
is	1
ours	1
check	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
we	1
took	1
lucy	1
into	1
another	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
been	1
prepared	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
forced	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
brandy	1
down	1
her	1
throat	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
van	1
helsing	1
tied	1
a	1
soft	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
round	1
her	1
throat	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
unconscious	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
worse	1
than	1
we	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
her	1
van	1
helsing	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
till	1
we	1
returned	1
and	1
then	1
beckoned	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
we	1
must	1
consult	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
we	1
descended	1
the	1
stairs	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
diningroom	1
door	1
and	1
we	1
passed	1
in	1
he	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
carefully	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
shutters	1
had	1
been	1
opened	1
but	1
the	1
blinds	1
were	1
already	1
down	1
with	1
that	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
etiquette	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
the	1
british	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
classes	1
always	1
rigidly	1
observes	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
therefore	1
dimly	1
dark	1
it	1
was	1
however	1
light	1
enough	1
for	1
our	1
purposes	1
van	1
helsings	1
sternness	1
was	1
somewhat	1
relieved	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
perplexity	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
torturing	1
his	1
mind	1
about	1
something	1
so	1
i	1
waited	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
turn	1
for	1
help	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
transfusion	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
that	1
soon	1
or	1
that	1
poor	1
girls	1
life	1
wont	1
be	1
worth	1
an	1
hours	1
purchase	1
you	1
are	1
exhausted	1
already	1
i	1
am	1
exhausted	1
too	1
i	1
fear	1
to	1
trust	1
those	1
women	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
courage	1
to	1
submit	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
will	1
open	1
his	1
veins	1
for	1
her	1
whats	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
anyhow	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
its	1
tones	1
brought	1
relief	1
and	1
joy	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
quincey	1
morris	1
van	1
helsing	1
started	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
sound	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
softened	1
and	1
a	1
glad	1
look	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
i	1
cried	1
out	1
quincey	1
morris	1
and	1
rushed	1
towards	1
him	1
with	1
outstretched	1
hands	1
what	1
brought	1
you	1
here	1
i	1
cried	1
as	1
our	1
hands	1
met	1
i	1
guess	1
art	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1

only	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1

van	1
helsing	1
strode	1
forward	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
looking	1
him	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
a	1
brave	1
mans	1
blood	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
on	1
this	1

men	1
when	1
we	1
want	1
them	1
once	1
again	1
we	1
went	1
through	1
that	1
ghastly	1
operation	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
with	1
the	1
details	1
lucy	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
terrible	1
shock	1
and	1
it	1
told	1
on	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
before	1
for	1
though	1
plenty	1
of	1
blood	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
veins	1
her	1
body	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
the	1
treatment	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
occasions	1
her	1
struggle	1
back	1
into	1
life	1
was	1
something	1
frightful	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
however	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
both	1
heart	1
and	1
lungs	1
improved	1
and	1
van	1
helsing	1
made	1
a	1
subcutaneous	1
injection	1
of	1
morphia	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
with	1
good	1
effect	1
her	1
faint	1
became	1
a	1
profound	1
slumber	1
the	1
professor	1
watched	1
whilst	1
i	1
went	1
downstairs	1
with	1
quincey	1
morris	1
and	1
sent	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
to	1
pay	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cabmen	1
who	1
were	1
waiting	1
i	1
left	1
quincey	1
lying	1
down	1
after	1
having	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
cook	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
a	1
good	1
breakfast	1
then	1
a	1
thought	1
struck	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
lucy	1
now	1
was	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
softly	1
in	1
i	1
found	1
van	1
helsing	1
with	1
a	1
sheet	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
notepaper	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
thinking	1
it	1
over	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
brow	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
grim	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
doubt	1
solved	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
the	1
paper	1
saying	1
only	1
it	1
dropped	1
from	1
lucys	1
breast	1
when	1
we	1
carried	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
bath	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
i	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
asked	1
him	1
in	1
gods	1
name	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
mean	1
was	1
she	1
or	1
is	1
she	1
mad	1
or	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
horrible	1
danger	1
is	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
bewildered	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
van	1
helsing	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
paper	1
saying	1
do	1
not	1
trouble	1
about	1
it	1
now	1
forget	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
and	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
later	1
and	1
now	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
brought	1
me	1
back	1
to	1
fact	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
all	1
myself	1
again	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
the	1
certificate	1
of	1
death	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
act	1
properly	1
and	1
wisely	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
an	1
inquest	1
and	1
that	1
paper	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
produced	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
have	1
no	1
inquest	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
it	1
would	1
surely	1
kill	1
poor	1
lucy	1
if	1
nothing	1
else	1
did	1
i	1
know	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
the	1
other	1

that	1

disease	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
certify	1
that	1
she	1
died	1
of	1
it	1
let	1
us	1
fill	1
up	1
the	1
certificate	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
registrar	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
undertaker	1

two	1
three	1

in	1
the	1
hall	1
i	1
met	1
quincey	1
morris	1
with	1
a	1
telegram	1
for	1
arthur	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
was	1
dead	1
that	1
lucy	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
ill	1
but	1

and	1
that	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
he	1
hurried	1
me	1
out	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
said	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
back	1
jack	1
may	1
i	1
have	1
two	1
words	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
ourselves	1
i	1
nodded	1
in	1
reply	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
i	1
found	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
the	1
registration	1
and	1
arranged	1
with	1
the	1
local	1
undertaker	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
to	1
measure	1
for	1
the	1
coffin	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
arrangements	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
back	1
quincey	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
knew	1
about	1
lucy	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
sleeping	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
seemingly	1
had	1
not	1
moved	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
from	1
his	1
putting	1
his	1
finger	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
i	1
gathered	1
that	1
he	1
expected	1
her	1
to	1
wake	1
before	1
long	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
forestalling	1
nature	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
quincey	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
breakfastroom	1
where	1
the	1
blinds	1
were	1
not	1
drawn	1
down	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
cheerful	1
or	1
rather	1
less	1
cheerless	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
rooms	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
he	1
said	1
to	1

that	1
time	1
you	1
two	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
transfusion	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
that	1
both	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
exhausted	1
now	1
i	1
know	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
medical	1
men	1
speak	1
in	1
camera	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
consult	1
about	1
in	1
private	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
common	1
matter	1
and	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
part	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
so	1
thats	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
both	1
you	1
and	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
done	1
already	1
what	1
i	1
did	1
today	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
so	1
thats	1
so	1
and	1
i	1
guess	1
art	1
was	1
in	1
it	1
too	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
four	1
days	1
ago	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
place	1
he	1
looked	1
queer	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
anything	1
pulled	1
down	1
so	1
quick	1
since	1
i	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
pampas	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
mare	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
go	1
to	1
grass	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
night	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
bats	1
that	1
they	1
call	1
vampires	1
had	1
got	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
his	1
gorge	1
and	1
the	1
vein	1
left	1
open	1
there	1
wasnt	1
enough	1
blood	1
in	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
stand	1
up	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
bullet	1
through	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
jack	1
if	1
you	1
may	1
tell	1
me	1
without	1
betraying	1
confidence	1
arthur	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
so	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
looked	1
terribly	1
anxious	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
torture	1
of	1
suspense	1
regarding	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
his	1
utter	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
mystery	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
surround	1
her	1
intensified	1
his	1
pain	1
his	1
very	1
heart	1
was	1
bleeding	1
and	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
manhood	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
royal	1
lot	1
of	1
it	1
too	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
from	1
breaking	1
down	1
i	1
paused	1
before	1
answering	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
betray	1
anything	1
which	1
the	1
professor	1
wished	1
kept	1
secret	1
but	1
already	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
guessed	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
not	1
answering	1
so	1
i	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
phrase	1
thats	1
so	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
has	1
this	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
about	1
ten	1
days	1
ten	1
days	1
then	1
i	1
guess	1
jack	1
seward	1
that	1
that	1
poor	1
pretty	1
creature	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
love	1
has	1
had	1
put	1
into	1
her	1
veins	1
within	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
four	1
strong	1
men	1
man	1
alive	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
wouldnt	1
hold	1
it	1
then	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
fierce	1
halfwhisper	1
what	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
i	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
that	1
i	1
said	1
is	1
the	1
crux	1
van	1
helsing	1
is	1
simply	1
frantic	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
at	1
my	1
wits	1
end	1
i	1
cant	1
even	1
hazard	1
a	1
guess	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
little	1
circumstances	1
which	1
have	1
thrown	1
out	1
all	1
our	1
calculations	1
as	1
to	1
lucy	1
being	1
properly	1
watched	1
but	1
these	1
shall	1
not	1
occur	1
again	1
here	1
we	1
stay	1
until	1
all	1
be	1
well	1
or	1
ill	1
quincey	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
	1
count	1
me	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
dutchman	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
ill	1
do	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
woke	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
lucys	1
first	1
movement	1
was	1
to	1
feel	1
in	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
produced	1
the	1
paper	1
which	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
careful	1
professor	1
had	1
replaced	1
it	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
lest	1
on	1
waking	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
alarmed	1
her	1
eye	1
then	1
lit	1
on	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
on	1
me	1
too	1
and	1
gladdened	1
then	1
she	1
looked	1
around	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
seeing	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
shuddered	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
loud	1
cry	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
poor	1
thin	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
pale	1
face	1
we	1
both	1
understood	1
what	1
that	1
meant	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
realised	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
her	1
mothers	1
death	1
so	1
we	1
tried	1
what	1
we	1
could	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
doubtless	1
sympathy	1
eased	1
her	1
somewhat	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
low	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
spirit	1
and	1
wept	1
silently	1
and	1
weakly	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
we	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
now	1
remain	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
towards	1
dusk	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
doze	1
here	1
a	1
very	1
odd	1
thing	1
occurred	1
whilst	1
still	1
asleep	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
paper	1
from	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
tore	1
it	1
in	1
two	1
van	1
helsing	1
stepped	1
over	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
pieces	1
from	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
however	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
tearing	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
material	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
finally	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
opened	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
scattering	1
the	1
fragments	1
van	1
helsing	1
seemed	1
surprised	1
and	1
his	1
brows	1
gathered	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
thought	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
19	1
september	1
all	1
last	1
night	1
she	1
slept	1
fitfully	1
being	1
always	1
afraid	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
something	1
weaker	1
when	1
she	1
woke	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
turns	1
to	1
watch	1
and	1
we	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
unattended	1
quincey	1
morris	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
his	1
intention	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
he	1
patrolled	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
came	1
its	1
searching	1
light	1
showed	1
the	1
ravages	1
in	1
poor	1
lucys	1
strength	1
she	1
was	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
nourishment	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
take	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
times	1
she	1
slept	1
and	1
both	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
noticed	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
her	1
between	1
sleeping	1
and	1
waking	1
whilst	1
asleep	1
she	1
looked	1
stronger	1
although	1
more	1
haggard	1
and	1
her	1
breathing	1
was	1
softer	1
her	1
open	1
mouth	1
showed	1
the	1
pale	1
gums	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
teeth	1
which	1
thus	1
looked	1
positively	1
longer	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
usual	1
when	1
she	1
woke	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
evidently	1
changed	1
the	1
expression	1
for	1
she	1
looked	1
her	1
own	1
self	1
although	1
a	1
dying	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
she	1
asked	1
for	1
arthur	1
and	1
we	1
telegraphed	1
for	1
him	1
quincey	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
when	1
he	1
arrived	1
it	1
was	1
nearly	1
six	1
oclock	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
setting	1
full	1
and	1
warm	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
light	1
streamed	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
gave	1
more	1
colour	1
to	1
the	1
pale	1
cheeks	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
arthur	1
was	1
simply	1
chocking	1
with	1
emotion	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
could	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
hours	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
fits	1
of	1
sleep	1
or	1
the	1
comatose	1
condition	1
that	1
passed	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
grown	1
more	1
frequent	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
pauses	1
when	1
conversation	1
was	1
possible	1
were	1
shortened	1
arthurs	1
presence	1
however	1
seemed	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
a	1
stimulant	1
she	1
rallied	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
more	1
brightly	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
since	1
we	1
arrived	1
he	1
too	1
pulled	1
himself	1
together	1
and	1
spoke	1
as	1
cheerily	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
everything	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
one	1
oclock	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
van	1
helsing	1
are	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
relieve	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
entering	1
this	1
on	1

oclock	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
rest	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
will	1
end	1
our	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
shock	1

more	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
another	1
outbreak	1
which	1

had	1
a	1
dreadful	1
ending	1
but	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
fortunately	1
happened	1
was	1
unattended	1
with	1
any	1
unhappy	1
results	1
this	1
afternoon	1
a	1
carriers	1
cart	1
with	1
two	1
men	1
made	1
a	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
whose	1
grounds	1
about	1
on	1
ours	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
patient	1
twice	1
ran	1
away	1
the	1
men	1
stopped	1
at	1
our	1
gate	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
porter	1
their	1
way	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
i	1
was	1
myself	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
window	1
having	1
a	1
smoke	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
renfields	1
room	1
the	1
patient	1
began	1
to	1
rate	1
him	1
from	1
within	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
foul	1
names	1
he	1
could	1
lay	1
his	1
tongue	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
seemed	1
a	1
decent	1
fellow	1
enough	1
contented	1
himself	1
by	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
shut	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
foulmouthed	1
beggar	1
whereon	1
our	1
man	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
robbing	1
him	1
and	1
wanting	1
to	1
murder	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
hinder	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
swing	1
for	1
it	1
i	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
signed	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
so	1
he	1
contented	1
himself	1
after	1
looking	1
the	1
place	1
over	1
and	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
by	1
saying	1
lor	1
bless	1
yer	1
sir	1
i	1
wouldnt	1
mind	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
bloomin	1
madhouse	1
i	1
pity	1
ye	1
and	1
the	1
guvnor	1
for	1
havin	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
like	1
that	1
then	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
way	1
civilly	1
enough	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
was	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
followed	1
by	1
threats	1
and	1
curses	1
and	1
revilings	1
from	1
our	1
man	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
any	1
cause	1
for	1
his	1
anger	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
usually	1
such	1
a	1
wellbehaved	1
man	1
and	1
except	1
his	1
violent	1
fits	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
had	1
ever	1
occurred	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment	1
quite	1
composed	1
and	1
most	1
genial	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
incident	1
but	1
he	1
blandly	1
asked	1
me	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
i	1
meant	1
and	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
completely	1
oblivious	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
however	1
only	1
another	1
instance	1
of	1
his	1
cunning	1
for	1
within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
again	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
was	1
running	1
down	1
the	1
avenue	1
i	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
attendants	1
to	1
follow	1
me	1
and	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
he	1
was	1
intent	1
on	1
some	1
mischief	1
my	1
fear	1
was	1
justified	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
same	1
cart	1
which	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
having	1
on	1
it	1
some	1
great	1
wooden	1
boxes	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
wiping	1
their	1
foreheads	1
and	1
were	1
flushed	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
violent	1
exercise	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
patient	1
rushed	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
pulling	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
off	1
the	1
cart	1
began	1
to	1
knock	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
ground	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seized	1
him	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
believe	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
man	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
fellow	1
jumped	1
down	1
and	1
struck	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
buttend	1
of	1
his	1
heavy	1
whip	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
blow	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
mind	1
it	1
but	1
seized	1
him	1
also	1
and	1
struggled	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
pulling	1
us	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
kittens	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
light	1
weight	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
both	1
burly	1
men	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
in	1
his	1
fighting	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
master	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
attendants	1
were	1
putting	1
a	1
straitwaistcoat	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
shout	1
ill	1
frustrate	1
them	1
they	1
shant	1
rob	1
me	1
they	1
shant	1
murder	1
me	1
by	1
inches	1
ill	1
fight	1
for	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
master	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
similar	1
incoherent	1
ravings	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
very	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
that	1
they	1
got	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
padded	1
room	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
attendants	1
hardy	1
had	1
a	1
finger	1
broken	1
however	1
i	1
set	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
well	1
the	1
two	1
carriers	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
loud	1
in	1
their	1
threats	1
of	1
actions	1
for	1
damages	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
rain	1
all	1
the	1
penalties	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
on	1
us	1
their	1
threats	1
were	1
however	1
mingled	1
with	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
indirect	1
apology	1
for	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
feeble	1
madman	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
way	1
their	1
strength	1
had	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
carrying	1
and	1
raising	1
the	1
heavy	1
boxes	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
short	1
work	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
gave	1
as	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
their	1
defeat	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
state	1
of	1
drouth	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
by	1
the	1
dusty	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
occupation	1
and	1
the	1
reprehensible	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
their	1
labours	1
of	1
any	1
place	1
of	1
public	1
entertainment	1
i	1
quite	1
understood	1
their	1
drift	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
stiff	1
glass	1
of	1
grog	1
or	1
rather	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
with	1
each	1
a	1
sovereign	1
in	1
hand	1
they	1
made	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
attack	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
encounter	1
a	1
worse	1
madman	1
any	1

lost	1
a	1
father	1
i	1
never	1
knew	1
either	1
father	1
or	1
mother	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
dear	1
old	1
mans	1
death	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
blow	1
to	1
me	1
jonathan	1
is	1
greatly	1
distressed	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
feels	1
sorrow	1
deep	1
sorrow	1
for	1
the	1
dear	1
good	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
befriended	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
has	1
treated	1
him	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
a	1
fortune	1
which	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
our	1
modest	1
bringing	1
up	1
is	1
wealth	1
beyond	1
the	1
dream	1
of	1
avarice	1
but	1
jonathan	1
feels	1
it	1
on	1
another	1
account	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
responsibility	1
which	1
it	1
puts	1
upon	1
him	1
makes	1
him	1
nervous	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
doubt	1
himself	1
i	1
try	1
to	1
cheer	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
my	1
belief	1
in	1
him	1
helps	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
himself	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
grave	1
shock	1
that	1
he	1
experienced	1
tells	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
hard	1
that	1
a	1
sweet	1
simple	1
noble	1
strong	1
nature	1
such	1
as	1
his	1

from	1
clerk	1

master	1

a	1

be	1
so	1
injured	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
its	1
strength	1
is	1
gone	1

with	1
my	1

of	1
the	1

all	1
in	1
it	1
including	1
life	1
itself	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
not	1

if	1
i	1
heard	1
this	1

the	1
flapping	1
of	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
flapping	1
those	1
grim	1
wings	1
to	1
some	1
purpose	1
of	1
late	1
lucys	1
mother	1
and	1
arthurs	1

and	1
now	1
let	1

get	1
on	1
with	1
my	1

duly	1
relieved	1
van	1
helsing	1
in	1
his	1
watch	1
over	1
lucy	1
we	1
wanted	1
arthur	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
rest	1
also	1
but	1
he	1
refused	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
help	1
us	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
all	1
break	1
down	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
rest	1
lest	1
lucy	1
should	1
suffer	1
that	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
him	1
come	1
my	1
child	1

said	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
sick	1
and	1
weak	1
and	1
have	1
had	1
much	1
sorrow	1
and	1
much	1
mental	1
pain	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
tax	1
on	1
your	1
strength	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
alone	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
fears	1
and	1
alarms	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
drawingroom	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
fire	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
sofas	1
you	1
shall	1
lie	1
on	1
one	1
and	1
i	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
our	1
sympathy	1
will	1
be	1
comfort	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
even	1
though	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
sleep	1
arthur	1
went	1
off	1
with	1
him	1
casting	1
back	1
a	1
longing	1
look	1
on	1
lucys	1
face	1
which	1
lay	1
on	1
her	1
pillow	1
almost	1
whiter	1
than	1
the	1
lawn	1
she	1
lay	1
quite	1
still	1
and	1
i	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
carried	1
out	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
purpose	1
of	1
using	1
the	1
garlic	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
windowsashes	1
reeked	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
round	1
lucys	1
neck	1
over	1
the	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
which	1
van	1
helsing	1
made	1
her	1
keep	1
on	1
was	1
a	1
rough	1
chaplet	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
odorous	1
flowers	1
lucy	1
was	1
breathing	1
somewhat	1
stertorously	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
at	1
its	1
worst	1
for	1
the	1
open	1
mouth	1
showed	1
the	1
pale	1
gums	1
her	1
teeth	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
uncertain	1
light	1
seemed	1
longer	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
particular	1
by	1
some	1
trick	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
the	1
canine	1
teeth	1
looked	1
longer	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
presently	1
she	1
moved	1
uneasily	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dull	1
flapping	1
or	1
buffeting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
it	1
softly	1
and	1
peeped	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
moonlight	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
noise	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
bat	1
which	1
wheeled	1
round	1
doubtless	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
although	1
so	1
dim	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
struck	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
its	1
wings	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
seat	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
lucy	1
had	1
moved	1
slightly	1
and	1
had	1
torn	1
away	1
the	1
garlic	1
flowers	1
from	1
her	1
throat	1
i	1
replaced	1
them	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
and	1
sat	1
watching	1
her	1
presently	1
she	1
woke	1
and	1
i	1
gave	1
her	1
food	1
as	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
prescribed	1
she	1
took	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
that	1
languidly	1
there	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
now	1
the	1
unconscious	1
struggle	1
for	1
life	1
and	1
strength	1
that	1
had	1
hitherto	1
so	1
marked	1
her	1
illness	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
curious	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
became	1
conscious	1
she	1
pressed	1
the	1
garlic	1
flowers	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
odd	1
that	1
whenever	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
that	1
lethargic	1
state	1
with	1
the	1
stertorous	1
breathing	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
flowers	1
from	1
her	1
but	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
waked	1
she	1
clutched	1
them	1
close	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
mistake	1
about	1
this	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
hours	1
that	1
followed	1
she	1
had	1
many	1
spells	1
of	1
sleeping	1
and	1
waking	1
and	1
repeated	1
both	1
actions	1
many	1
times	1
at	1
six	1
oclock	1
van	1
helsing	1
came	1
to	1
relieve	1
me	1
arthur	1
had	1
then	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
doze	1
and	1
he	1
mercifully	1
let	1
him	1
sleep	1
on	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
lucys	1
face	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
hissing	1
indraw	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
sharp	1
whisper	1
draw	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
i	1
want	1
light	1
then	1
he	1
bent	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
almost	1
touching	1
lucys	1
examined	1
her	1
carefully	1
he	1
removed	1
the	1
flowers	1
and	1
lifted	1
the	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
from	1
her	1
throat	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
started	1
back	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
his	1
ejaculation	1
mein	1
gott	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
smothered	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
looked	1
too	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
noticed	1
some	1
queer	1
chill	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
the	1
wounds	1
on	1
the	1
throat	1
had	1
absolutely	1
disappeared	1
for	1
fully	1
five	1
minutes	1
van	1
helsing	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
its	1
sternest	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
calmly	1
she	1
is	1
dying	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
difference	1
mark	1
me	1
whether	1
she	1
dies	1
conscious	1
or	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
wake	1
that	1
poor	1
boy	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
last	1
he	1
trusts	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
promised	1
him	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
diningroom	1
and	1
waked	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
dazed	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
sunlight	1
streaming	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
shutters	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
late	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
fear	1
i	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
lucy	1
was	1
still	1
asleep	1
but	1
told	1
him	1
as	1
gently	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
that	1
both	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
near	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
slid	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
by	1
the	1
sofa	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
perhaps	1
a	1
minute	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
buried	1
praying	1
whilst	1
his	1
shoulders	1
shook	1
with	1
grief	1
i	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
come	1
i	1
said	1
my	1
dear	1
old	1
fellow	1
summon	1
all	1
your	1
fortitude	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
and	1
easiest	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
into	1
lucys	1
room	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
forethought	1
been	1
putting	1
matters	1
straight	1
and	1
making	1
everything	1
look	1
as	1
pleasing	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
had	1
even	1
brushed	1
lucys	1
hair	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
in	1
its	1
usual	1
sunny	1
ripples	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
whispered	1
softly	1
arthur	1
oh	1
my	1
love	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
he	1
was	1
stooping	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
motioned	1
him	1
back	1
no	1
he	1
whispered	1
not	1
yet	1
hold	1
her	1
hand	1
it	1
will	1
comfort	1
her	1
more	1
so	1
arthur	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
knelt	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
her	1
best	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
soft	1
lines	1
matching	1
the	1
angelic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
then	1
gradually	1
her	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
she	1
sank	1
to	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
her	1
breast	1
heaved	1
softly	1
and	1
her	1
breath	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
like	1
a	1
tired	1
childs	1
and	1
then	1
insensibly	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
strange	1
change	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
her	1
breathing	1
grew	1
stertorous	1
the	1
mouth	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
pale	1
gums	1
drawn	1
back	1
made	1
the	1
teeth	1
look	1
longer	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sleepwaking	1
vague	1
unconscious	1
way	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
now	1
dull	1
and	1
hard	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
voluptuous	1
voice	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
arthur	1
oh	1
my	1
love	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
kiss	1
me	1
arthur	1
bent	1
eagerly	1
over	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
van	1
helsing	1
who	1
like	1
me	1
had	1
been	1
startled	1
by	1
her	1
voice	1
swooped	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
catching	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
neck	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
dragged	1
him	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
fury	1
of	1
strength	1
which	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
possessed	1
and	1
actually	1
hurled	1
him	1
almost	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
life	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
living	1
soul	1
and	1
hers	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
between	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
lion	1
at	1
bay	1
arthur	1
was	1
so	1
taken	1
aback	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
say	1
and	1
before	1
any	1
impulse	1
of	1
violence	1
could	1
seize	1
him	1
he	1
realised	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
stood	1
silent	1
waiting	1
i	1
kept	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
lucy	1
as	1
did	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
spasm	1
as	1
of	1
rage	1
flit	1
like	1
a	1
shadow	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
champed	1
together	1
then	1
her	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
she	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
very	1
shortly	1
after	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
softness	1
and	1
putting	1
out	1
her	1
poor	1
pale	1
thin	1
hand	1
took	1
van	1
helsings	1
great	1
brown	1
one	1
drawing	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
kissed	1
it	1
my	1
true	1
friend	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
faint	1
voice	1
but	1
with	1
untellable	1
pathos	1
my	1
true	1
friend	1
and	1
his	1
oh	1
guard	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
peace	1
i	1
swear	1
it	1
said	1
he	1
solemnly	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
registers	1
an	1
oath	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
arthur	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
come	1
my	1
child	1
take	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
yours	1
and	1
kiss	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
instead	1
of	1
their	1
lips	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
parted	1
lucys	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
van	1
helsing	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
closely	1
took	1
arthurs	1
arm	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
away	1
and	1
then	1
lucys	1
breathing	1
became	1
stertorous	1
again	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
ceased	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
she	1
is	1
dead	1
i	1
took	1
arthur	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
drawingroom	1
where	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
sobbing	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
nearly	1
broke	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
van	1
helsing	1
looking	1
at	1
poor	1
lucy	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
sterner	1
than	1
ever	1
some	1
change	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
her	1
body	1
death	1
had	1
given	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
for	1
her	1
brow	1
and	1
cheeks	1
had	1
recovered	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
flowing	1
lines	1
even	1
the	1
lips	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
deadly	1
pallor	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
blood	1
no	1
longer	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
harshness	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
little	1
rude	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
we	1
thought	1
her	1
dying	1
whilst	1
she	1
slept	1
and	1
sleeping	1
when	1
she	1
died	1
i	1
stood	1
beside	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
said	1
ah	1
well	1
poor	1
girl	1
there	1
is	1
peace	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
grave	1
solemnity	1
not	1
so	1
alas	1
not	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
beginning	1
when	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
he	1
only	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
answered	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
as	1
yet	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
chapter	1
xiii	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
the	1
funeral	1
was	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
succeeding	1
day	1
so	1
that	1
lucy	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
might	1
be	1
buried	1
together	1
i	1
attended	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ghastly	1
formalities	1
and	1
the	1
urbane	1
undertaker	1
proved	1
that	1
his	1
staff	1
were	1
afflicted	1
or	1
blessed	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
obsequious	1
suavity	1
even	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
performed	1
the	1
last	1
offices	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
remarked	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
confidential	1
brotherprofessional	1
way	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
deathchamber	1
she	1
makes	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
corpse	1
sir	1
its	1
quite	1
a	1
privilege	1
to	1
attend	1
on	1
her	1
its	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
credit	1
to	1
our	1
establishment	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
van	1
helsing	1
never	1
kept	1
far	1
away	1
this	1
was	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
disordered	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
household	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
relatives	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
as	1
arthur	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
attend	1
at	1
his	1
fathers	1
funeral	1
we	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
notify	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
bidden	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
upon	1
ourselves	1
to	1
examine	1
papers	1
etc	1
he	1
insisted	1
upon	1
looking	1
over	1
lucys	1
papers	1
himself	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
foreigner	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
quite	1
aware	1
of	1
english	1
legal	1
requirements	1
and	1
so	1
might	1
in	1
ignorance	1
make	1
some	1
unnecessary	1
trouble	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
forget	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
lawyer	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
doctor	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
altogether	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
you	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
avoided	1
the	1
coroner	1
i	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
him	1
to	1
avoid	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
papers	1
more	1
such	1
as	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
the	1
memorandum	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
lucys	1
breast	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
torn	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
when	1
you	1
find	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
solicitor	1
who	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
late	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
seal	1
all	1
her	1
papers	1
and	1
write	1
him	1
tonight	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
watch	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
in	1
miss	1
lucys	1
old	1
room	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
i	1
myself	1
search	1
for	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
well	1
that	1
her	1
very	1
thoughts	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
strangers	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
half	1
hour	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
address	1
of	1
mrs	1
westenras	1
solicitor	1
and	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
ladys	1
papers	1
were	1
in	1
order	1
explicit	1
directions	1
regarding	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
burial	1
were	1
given	1
i	1
had	1
hardly	1
sealed	1
the	1
letter	1
when	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
van	1
helsing	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
saying	1
can	1
i	1
help	1
you	1
friend	1
john	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
my	1
service	1
is	1
to	1
you	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
what	1
you	1
looked	1
for	1
i	1
asked	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
replied	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
for	1
any	1
specific	1
thing	1
i	1
only	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
and	1
find	1
i	1
have	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
was	1

some	1
letters	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
memoranda	1
and	1
a	1
diary	1
new	1
begun	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
them	1
here	1
and	1
we	1

for	1
the	1
present	1

i	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
poor	1
lad	1
tomorrow	1
evening	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
sanction	1
i	1
shall	1
use	1
some	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
hand	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
friend	1

for	1
the	1
tonight	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
us	1
alas	1
before	1
turning	1
in	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
poor	1
lucy	1
the	1
undertaker	1
had	1
certainly	1
done	1
his	1
work	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
chapelle	1
ardente	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wilderness	1
of	1
beautiful	1
white	1
flowers	1
and	1
death	1
was	1
made	1
as	1
little	1
repulsive	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
windingsheet	1
was	1
laid	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
gently	1
back	1
we	1
both	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
beauty	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
tall	1
wax	1
candies	1
showing	1
a	1
sufficient	1
light	1
to	1
note	1
it	1
well	1
all	1
lucys	1
loveliness	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
hours	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
instead	1
of	1
leaving	1
traces	1
of	1
decays	1
effacing	1
fingers	1
had	1
but	1
restored	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
life	1
till	1
positively	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
my	1

that	1
i	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
corpse	1
the	1
professor	1

sternly	1
grave	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
loved	1
her	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
remain	1
till	1
i	1
return	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
wild	1
garlic	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1

the	1
flowers	1
amongst	1
the	1

on	1
and	1
around	1
the	1

then	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
neck	1
inside	1
his	1
collar	1
a	1
little	1
gold	1
crucifix	1
and	1
placed	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
mouth	1
he	1
restored	1
the	1
sheet	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
i	1
was	1
undressing	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
premonitory	1
tap	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
entered	1
and	1
at	1

oh	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
john	1
that	1
you	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
i	1

i	1
that	1

and	1
you	1

only	1
help	1
i	1

it	1
tonight	1
but	1
for	1
arthur	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
after	1
his	1
fathers	1
funeral	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
then	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
coffined	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
you	1

unscrew	1
the	1
coffinlid	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
our	1
operation	1

then	1
replace	1
all	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
know	1
save	1
we	1
alone	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
girl	1
is	1
dead	1
why	1
mutilate	1
her	1
poor	1
body	1
without	1
need	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
a	1
postmortem	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
gain	1
by	1
it	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
science	1
to	1
human	1
knowledge	1
why	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
such	1
it	1
is	1
monstrous	1
for	1
answer	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
infinite	1
tenderness	1
friend	1
john	1
i	1
pity	1
your	1
poor	1
bleeding	1
heart	1
and	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
it	1
does	1
so	1
bleed	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
would	1
take	1
on	1
myself	1
the	1
burden	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
bear	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
and	1
bless	1
me	1
for	1
knowing	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
pleasant	1
things	1
john	1
my	1
child	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
friend	1
now	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
yet	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
know	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
without	1
good	1
cause	1
i	1
may	1
err	1
i	1
am	1
but	1
man	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
these	1
causes	1
that	1
you	1
send	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
trouble	1
came	1
yes	1
were	1
you	1
not	1
amazed	1
nay	1
horrified	1
when	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
arthur	1
kiss	1
his	1
love	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
dying	1
and	1
snatched	1
him	1
away	1
by	1
all	1
my	1
strength	1
yes	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
saw	1
how	1
she	1
thanked	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
so	1
beautiful	1
dying	1
eyes	1
her	1
voice	1
too	1
so	1
weak	1
and	1
she	1
kiss	1
my	1
rough	1
old	1
hand	1
and	1
bless	1
me	1
yes	1
and	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
hear	1
me	1
swear	1
promise	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
so	1
she	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
grateful	1
yes	1
well	1
i	1
have	1
good	1
reason	1
now	1
for	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
have	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
trust	1
me	1
you	1
have	1
believe	1
me	1
weeks	1
past	1
when	1
there	1
be	1
things	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
well	1
doubt	1
believe	1
me	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
friend	1
john	1
if	1
you	1
trust	1
me	1
not	1
then	1
i	1
must	1
tell	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
perhaps	1
well	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
work	1
as	1
work	1
i	1
shall	1
no	1
matter	1
trust	1
or	1
no	1
trust	1
without	1
my	1
friend	1
trust	1
in	1
me	1
i	1
work	1
with	1
heavy	1
heart	1
and	1
feel	1
oh	1
so	1
lonely	1
when	1
i	1
want	1
all	1
help	1
and	1
courage	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
he	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
solemnly	1
friend	1
john	1
there	1
are	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
days	1
before	1
us	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
two	1
but	1
one	1
that	1
so	1
we	1
work	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
end	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
me	1
i	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
promised	1
him	1
i	1
held	1
my	1
door	1
open	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
and	1
watched	1
him	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
close	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
without	1
moving	1
i	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
pass	1
silently	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
back	1
towards	1
me	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
lucy	1
lay	1
the	1
sight	1
touched	1
me	1
devotion	1
is	1
so	1
rare	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
show	1
it	1
unasked	1
to	1
those	1
we	1
love	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
girl	1
putting	1
aside	1
the	1
terrors	1
which	1
she	1
naturally	1
had	1
of	1
death	1
to	1
go	1
watch	1
alone	1
by	1
the	1
bier	1
of	1
the	1
mistress	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
clay	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
lonely	1
till	1
laid	1
to	1
eternal	1
rest	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
slept	1
long	1
and	1
soundly	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
broad	1
daylight	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
waked	1
me	1
by	1
coming	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
he	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
my	1
bedside	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
trouble	1
about	1
the	1
knives	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
why	1
not	1
i	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
had	1
greatly	1
impressed	1
me	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
sternly	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
or	1
too	1
early	1
see	1
here	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
little	1
golden	1
crucifix	1
this	1
was	1
stolen	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
how	1
stolen	1
i	1
asked	1
in	1
wonder	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
it	1
now	1
because	1
i	1
get	1
it	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
worthless	1
wretch	1
who	1
stole	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
robbed	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
her	1
punishment	1
will	1
surely	1
come	1
but	1
not	1
through	1
me	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
altogether	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
and	1
thus	1
unknowing	1
she	1
only	1
stole	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
leaving	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
mystery	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
puzzle	1
to	1
grapple	1
with	1
the	1
forenoon	1
was	1
a	1
dreary	1
time	1
but	1
at	1
noon	1
the	1
solicitor	1
came	1
mr	1
marquand	1
of	1
wholeman	1
sons	1
marquand	1
	1
lidderdale	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
genial	1
and	1
very	1
appreciative	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
our	1
hands	1
all	1
cares	1
as	1
to	1
details	1
during	1
lunch	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
expected	1
sudden	1
death	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
affairs	1
in	1
absolute	1
order	1
he	1
informed	1
us	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
entailed	1
property	1
of	1
lucys	1
fathers	1
which	1
now	1
in	1
default	1
of	1
direct	1
issue	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
distant	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
the	1
whole	1
estate	1
real	1
and	1
personal	1
was	1
left	1
absolutely	1
to	1
arthur	1
holmwood	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
frankly	1
we	1
did	1
our	1
best	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
testamentary	1
disposition	1
and	1
pointed	1
out	1
certain	1
contingencies	1
that	1
might	1
leave	1
her	1
daughter	1
either	1
penniless	1
or	1
not	1
so	1
free	1
as	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
act	1
regarding	1
a	1
matrimonial	1
alliance	1
indeed	1
we	1
pressed	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
we	1
almost	1
came	1
into	1
collision	1
for	1
she	1
asked	1
us	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
or	1
were	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
her	1
wishes	1
of	1
course	1
we	1
had	1
then	1
no	1
alternative	1
but	1
to	1
accept	1
we	1
were	1
right	1
in	1
principle	1
and	1
ninetynine	1
times	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
proved	1
by	1
the	1
logic	1
of	1
events	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
our	1
judgment	1
frankly	1
however	1
i	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
any	1
other	1
form	1
of	1
disposition	1
would	1
have	1
rendered	1
impossible	1
the	1
carrying	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
wishes	1
for	1
by	1
her	1
predeceasing	1
her	1
daughter	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
into	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
even	1
had	1
she	1
only	1
survived	1
her	1
mother	1
by	1
five	1
minutes	1
her	1
property	1
would	1
in	1
case	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
will	1
and	1
a	1
will	1
was	1
a	1
practical	1
impossibility	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
have	1
been	1
treated	1
at	1
her	1
decease	1
as	1
under	1
intestacy	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
lord	1
godalming	1
though	1
so	1
dear	1
a	1
friend	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
claim	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
inheritors	1
being	1
remote	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
abandon	1
their	1
just	1
rights	1
for	1
sentimental	1
reasons	1
regarding	1
an	1
entire	1
stranger	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
my	1

was	1
a	1
good	1
fellow	1
but	1
his	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
little	1
part	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
officially	1
interested	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
tragedy	1
was	1
an	1
objectlesson	1
in	1
the	1
limitations	1
of	1
sympathetic	1
understanding	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
remain	1
long	1
but	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
look	1
in	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
see	1
lord	1
godalming	1
his	1
coming	1
however	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
certain	1
comfort	1
to	1
us	1
since	1
it	1
assured	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
have	1

criticism	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
acts	1
arthur	1
was	1
expected	1
at	1
five	1
oclock	1
so	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
that	1
time	1
we	1
visited	1
the	1
deathchamber	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
in	1
very	1
truth	1
for	1
now	1
both	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
lay	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
undertaker	1
true	1
to	1
his	1
craft	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
best	1
display	1
he	1
could	1
of	1
his	1
goods	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mortuary	1
air	1
about	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
lowered	1
our	1
spirits	1
at	1
once	1
van	1
helsing	1
ordered	1
the	1
former	1
arrangement	1
to	1
be	1
adhered	1
to	1
explaining	1
that	1
as	1
lord	1
godalming	1
was	1
coming	1
very	1
soon	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
harrowing	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
fiancee	1
quite	1
alone	1
the	1
undertaker	1
seemed	1
shocked	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
stupidity	1
and	1
exerted	1
himself	1
to	1
restore	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
left	1
them	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
arthur	1
came	1
such	1
shocks	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
avoid	1
were	1
saved	1
poor	1
fellow	1
he	1
looked	1
desperately	1
sad	1
and	1
broken	1
even	1
his	1
stalwart	1
manhood	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
shrunk	1
somewhat	1
under	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
his	1
muchtried	1
emotions	1
he	1
had	1
i	1
knew	1
been	1
very	1
genuinely	1
and	1
devotedly	1
attached	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
to	1
lose	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
was	1
a	1
bitter	1
blow	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
warm	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
he	1
was	1
sweetly	1
courteous	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
constraint	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
professor	1
noticed	1
it	1
too	1
and	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
upstairs	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
i	1
felt	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
me	1
in	1
saying	1
huskily	1
you	1
loved	1
her	1
too	1
old	1
fellow	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
friend	1
had	1
a	1
closer	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
than	1
you	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
her	1
i	1
cant	1
think	1
yet	1
here	1
he	1
suddenly	1
broke	1
down	1
and	1
threw	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
my	1
shoulders	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
my	1
breast	1
crying	1
oh	1
jack	1
jack	1
what	1
shall	1
i	1
do	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
life	1
seems	1
gone	1
from	1
me	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
world	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
i	1
comforted	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
men	1
do	1
not	1
need	1
much	1
expression	1
a	1
grip	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
the	1
tightening	1
of	1
an	1
arm	1
over	1
the	1
shoulder	1
a	1
sob	1
in	1
unison	1
are	1
expressions	1
of	1
sympathy	1
dear	1
to	1
a	1
mans	1
heart	1
i	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
silent	1
till	1
his	1
sobs	1
died	1
away	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
said	1
softly	1
to	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
together	1
we	1
moved	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
i	1
lifted	1
the	1
lawn	1
from	1
her	1
face	1
god	1
how	1
beautiful	1
she	1
was	1
every	1
hour	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
enhancing	1
her	1
loveliness	1
it	1
frightened	1
and	1
amazed	1
me	1
somewhat	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
arthur	1
he	1
fell	1
atrembling	1
and	1
finally	1
was	1
shaken	1
with	1
doubt	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
ague	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
faint	1
whisper	1
jack	1
is	1
she	1
really	1
dead	1
i	1
assured	1
him	1
sadly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
suggest	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
horrible	1
doubt	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
life	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
longer	1
than	1
i	1
could	1
help	1
that	1
it	1
often	1
happened	1
that	1
after	1
death	1
faces	1
became	1
softened	1
and	1
even	1
resolved	1
into	1
their	1
youthful	1
beauty	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
especially	1
so	1
when	1
death	1
had	1
been	1
preceded	1
by	1
any	1
acute	1
or	1
prolonged	1
suffering	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
quite	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
any	1
doubt	1
and	1
after	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
the	1
couch	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
lovingly	1
and	1
long	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
goodbye	1
as	1
the	1
coffin	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
dead	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead	1
he	1
came	1
away	1
fondly	1
looking	1
back	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
i	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
drawingroom	1
and	1
told	1
van	1
helsing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
goodbye	1
so	1
the	1
latter	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
undertakers	1
men	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
the	1
preparations	1
and	1
to	1
screw	1
up	1
the	1
coffin	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
again	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
arthurs	1
question	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
surprised	1
just	1
now	1
i	1
doubted	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
myself	1
we	1
all	1
dined	1
together	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
poor	1
art	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
things	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
all	1
dinnertime	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
lit	1
our	1
cigars	1
he	1
said	1
lord	1
but	1
arthur	1
interrupted	1
him	1
no	1
no	1
not	1
that	1
for	1
gods	1
sake	1
not	1
yet	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
forgive	1
me	1
sir	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
speak	1
offensively	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
my	1
loss	1
is	1
so	1
recent	1
the	1
professor	1
answered	1
very	1
sweetly	1
i	1
only	1
used	1
that	1
name	1
because	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
call	1
you	1
mrand	1
i	1
have	1
grown	1
to	1
love	1
you	1
yes	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
to	1
love	1
you	1
as	1
arthur	1
arthur	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
old	1
mans	1
warmly	1
call	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
may	1
always	1
have	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
words	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
goodness	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
dear	1
he	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
your	1
goodness	1
even	1
better	1
than	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
was	1
rude	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
wanting	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
you	1
acted	1
so	1
you	1
remember	1
the	1
professor	1
nodded	1
you	1
must	1
forgive	1
me	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
kindness	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
quite	1
trust	1
me	1
then	1
for	1
to	1
trust	1
such	1
violence	1
needs	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
trust	1
me	1
now	1
for	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
yet	1
understand	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
times	1
when	1
i	1
shall	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
trust	1
when	1
you	1
cannot	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
yet	1
understand	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
your	1
trust	1
shall	1
be	1
whole	1
and	1
complete	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
shall	1
understand	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
sunlight	1
himself	1
shone	1
through	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
bless	1
me	1
from	1
first	1
to	1
last	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
others	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
dear	1
sake	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
swore	1
to	1
protect	1
and	1
indeed	1
indeed	1
sir	1
said	1
arthur	1
warmly	1
i	1
shall	1
in	1
all	1
ways	1
trust	1
you	1
i	1

a	1
very	1

his	1
throat	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
times	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
to	1
speak	1

between	1

no	1

may	1

about	1
it	1
down	1
it	1
all	1
goes	1
i	1
am	1
rusty	1
in	1
my	1
shorthand	1
see	1
what	1
unexpected	1
prosperity	1
does	1
for	1
us	1
so	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
freshen	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
an	1
exercise	1
anyhow	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
very	1
solemn	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
ourselves	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
there	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
old	1
friends	1
of	1
his	1
from	1
exeter	1
his	1
london	1
agent	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
representing	1
sir	1
john	1
paxton	1
the	1
president	1
of	1
the	1
incorporated	1
law	1
society	1
jonathan	1
and	1
i	1
stood	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
we	1
felt	1
that	1
our	1
best	1
and	1
dearest	1
friend	1
was	1
gone	1
from	1
us	1
we	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
town	1
quietly	1
taking	1
a	1
bus	1
to	1
hyde	1
park	1
corner	1
jonathan	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
interest	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
row	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
so	1
we	1
sat	1
down	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
few	1
people	1
there	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
sadlooking	1
and	1
desolate	1
to	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
empty	1
chairs	1
it	1
made	1
us	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
chair	1
at	1
home	1
so	1
we	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
down	1
piccadilly	1
jonathan	1
was	1
holding	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
before	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
school	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
very	1
improper	1
for	1
you	1
cant	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
years	1
teaching	1
etiquette	1
and	1
decorum	1
to	1
other	1
girls	1
without	1
the	1
pedantry	1
of	1
it	1
biting	1
into	1
yourself	1
a	1
bit	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
jonathan	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
we	1
didnt	1
know	1
anybody	1
who	1
saw	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
didnt	1
care	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
on	1
we	1
walked	1
i	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
big	1
cartwheel	1
flat	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
victoria	1
outside	1
giulianos	1
when	1
i	1
felt	1
jonathan	1
clutch	1
my	1
arm	1
so	1
tight	1
that	1
he	1
hurt	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
under	1
his	1
breath	1
my	1
god	1
i	1
am	1
always	1
anxious	1
about	1
jonathan	1
for	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
some	1
nervous	1
fit	1
may	1
upset	1
him	1
again	1
so	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
quickly	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
disturbed	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
bulging	1
out	1
as	1
half	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
half	1
in	1
amazement	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
a	1
tall	1
thin	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
beaky	1
nose	1
and	1
black	1
moustache	1
and	1
pointed	1
beard	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
observing	1
the	1
pretty	1
girl	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
either	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
view	1
of	1
him	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
face	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
and	1
cruel	1
and	1
sensual	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
white	1
teeth	1
that	1
looked	1
all	1
the	1
whiter	1
because	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
so	1
red	1
were	1
pointed	1
like	1
an	1
animals	1
jonathan	1
kept	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
till	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
would	1
notice	1
i	1
feared	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
ill	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
fierce	1
and	1
nasty	1
i	1
asked	1
jonathan	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
disturbed	1
and	1
he	1
answered	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
i	1
knew	1
as	1
much	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
dear	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
his	1
answer	1
seemed	1
to	1
shock	1
and	1
thrill	1
me	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
mina	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
the	1
poor	1
dear	1
was	1
evidently	1
terrified	1
at	1
something	1
very	1
greatly	1
terrified	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
me	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
and	1
to	1
support	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
sunk	1
down	1
he	1
kept	1
staring	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shop	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
parcel	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
then	1
drove	1
off	1
the	1
dark	1
man	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
carriage	1
moved	1
up	1
piccadilly	1
he	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
and	1
hailed	1
a	1
hansom	1
jonathan	1
kept	1
looking	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
himself	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
count	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
grown	1
young	1
my	1
god	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
so	1
oh	1
my	1
god	1
my	1
god	1
if	1
i	1
only	1
knew	1
if	1
i	1
only	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
distressing	1
himself	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
by	1
asking	1
him	1
any	1
questions	1
so	1
i	1
remained	1
silent	1
i	1
drew	1
him	1
away	1
quietly	1
and	1
he	1
holding	1
my	1
arm	1
came	1
easily	1
we	1
walked	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
green	1
park	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
hot	1
day	1
for	1
autumn	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
comfortable	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
shady	1
place	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
staring	1
at	1
nothing	1
jonathans	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
quietly	1
into	1
a	1
sleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
disturb	1
him	1
in	1
about	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
quite	1
cheerfully	1
why	1
mina	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
asleep	1
oh	1
do	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
rude	1
come	1
and	1
well	1
have	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
somewhere	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
forgotten	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
dark	1
stranger	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
illness	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
episode	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
i	1
dont	1
like	1
this	1
lapsing	1
into	1
forgetfulness	1
it	1
may	1
make	1
or	1
continue	1
some	1
injury	1
to	1
the	1
brain	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
fear	1
i	1
shall	1
do	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
good	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
somehow	1
learn	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
his	1
journey	1
abroad	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
i	1
fear	1
when	1
i	1
must	1
open	1
that	1
parcel	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
written	1
oh	1
jonathan	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
know	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
wrong	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
dear	1
sake	1
later	1
a	1
sad	1
homecoming	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
the	1
house	1
empty	1
of	1
the	1
dear	1
soul	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
us	1
jonathan	1
still	1
pale	1
and	1
dizzy	1
under	1
a	1
slight	1
relapse	1
of	1
his	1
malady	1
and	1
now	1
a	1
telegram	1
from	1
van	1

be	1
made	1
personally	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
stop	1
with	1
me	1
then	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
he	1

he	1
has	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
london	1
which	1
may	1
take	1
him	1
some	1
time	1
poor	1
old	1
fellow	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
week	1
has	1
broken	1
down	1
even	1
his	1
iron	1
strength	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
burial	1
he	1
was	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
putting	1
some	1
terrible	1
restraint	1
on	1
himself	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
we	1
were	1
standing	1
beside	1
arthur	1
who	1
poor	1
fellow	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
operation	1
where	1
his	1
blood	1
had	1
been	1
transfused	1
to	1
his	1
lucys	1
veins	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
van	1
helsings	1
face	1
grow	1
white	1
and	1
purple	1
by	1
turns	1
arthur	1
was	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
since	1
then	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
two	1
had	1
been	1
really	1
married	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
god	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
operations	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
ever	1
shall	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
went	1
away	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
came	1
on	1
here	1
the	1
moment	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
regular	1
fit	1
of	1
hysterics	1
he	1
has	1
denied	1
to	1
me	1
since	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hysterics	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
humour	1
asserting	1
itself	1
under	1
very	1
terrible	1
conditions	1
he	1
laughed	1
till	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
draw	1
down	1
the	1
blinds	1
lest	1
any	1
one	1
should	1
see	1
us	1
and	1
misjudge	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
cried	1
till	1
he	1
laughed	1
again	1
and	1
laughed	1
and	1
cried	1
together	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
does	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
stern	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
are	1
so	1
different	1
in	1
manifestations	1
of	1
nervous	1
strength	1
or	1
weakness	1
then	1
where	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
grave	1
and	1
stern	1
again	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
his	1
mirth	1
and	1
why	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
logical	1
and	1
forceful	1
and	1
mysterious	1
he	1
said	1
ah	1
you	1
dont	1
comprehend	1
friend	1
john	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
sad	1
though	1
i	1
laugh	1
see	1
i	1
have	1
cried	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
laugh	1
did	1
choke	1
me	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
all	1
sorry	1
when	1
i	1
cry	1
for	1
the	1
laugh	1
he	1
come	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
keep	1
it	1
always	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
laughter	1
who	1
knock	1
at	1
your	1
door	1
and	1
say	1
may	1
i	1
come	1
in	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
true	1
laughter	1
no	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
he	1

when	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
like	1
he	1
ask	1
no	1
person	1

no	1
time	1
of	1
suitability	1
he	1

i	1
am	1
here	1
behold	1
in	1
example	1
i	1
grieve	1
my	1
heart	1
out	1
for	1
that	1
so	1
sweet	1
young	1
girl	1
i	1
give	1
my	1
blood	1
for	1
her	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
worn	1
i	1
give	1
my	1
time	1
my	1
skill	1
my	1
sleep	1
i	1
let	1
my	1
other	1
sufferers	1

that	1
so	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
all	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
can	1
laugh	1
at	1
her	1
very	1
grave	1
laugh	1
when	1

clay	1
from	1

spade	1
of	1
the	1
sexton	1

upon	1

back	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
my	1
cheek	1
my	1
heart	1

for	1
that	1
poor	1
boy	1
that	1
dear	1
boy	1
so	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
boy	1
had	1
i	1
been	1
so	1
blessed	1
that	1

with	1
his	1

now	1
why	1

you	1
friend	1
john	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
more	1
level	1
in	1
experiences	1
than	1
father	1

even	1
at	1
such	1
moment	1
king	1
laugh	1

come	1
to	1
me	1
and	1

back	1
and	1

some	1
of	1
the	1
sunshine	1
that	1
he	1
carry	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
cheek	1
oh	1
friend	1
john	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
world	1
a	1
sad	1
world	1
a	1
world	1
full	1
of	1
miseries	1
and	1
woes	1
and	1
troubles	1
and	1
yet	1
when	1
king	1
laugh	1
come	1
he	1
make	1
them	1
all	1
dance	1
to	1
the	1
tune	1
he	1
play	1
bleeding	1
hearts	1
and	1
dry	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
and	1
tears	1
that	1
burn	1
as	1
they	1
fall	1
all	1
dance	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
that	1
he	1
make	1
with	1
that	1
smileless	1
mouth	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
friend	1
john	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
kind	1
ah	1
we	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
are	1
like	1
ropes	1
drawn	1
tight	1
with	1
strain	1
that	1
pull	1
us	1
different	1
ways	1
then	1
tears	1
come	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
ropes	1
they	1
brace	1
us	1
up	1
until	1
perhaps	1
the	1
strain	1
become	1
too	1
great	1
and	1
we	1
break	1
but	1
king	1
laugh	1
he	1
come	1
like	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
he	1
ease	1
off	1
the	1
strain	1
again	1
and	1
we	1
bear	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
our	1
labour	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
wound	1
him	1
by	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
idea	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
understand	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
laughter	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
the	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
stern	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
tone	1
oh	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
grim	1
irony	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
this	1
so	1
lovely	1
lady	1
garlanded	1
with	1
flowers	1
that	1
looked	1
so	1
fair	1
as	1
life	1
till	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
we	1
wondered	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
truly	1
dead	1
she	1
laid	1
in	1
that	1
so	1
fine	1
marble	1
house	1
in	1
that	1
lonely	1
churchyard	1
where	1
rest	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
kin	1
laid	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
mother	1
who	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
that	1
sacred	1
bell	1
going	1
toll	1
toll	1
toll	1
so	1
sad	1
and	1
slow	1
and	1
those	1
holy	1
men	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
garments	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
pretending	1
to	1
read	1
books	1
and	1
yet	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
their	1
eyes	1
never	1
on	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
bowed	1
head	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
is	1
dead	1
so	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
professor	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
cant	1
see	1
anything	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
why	1
your	1
explanation	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
harder	1
puzzle	1
than	1
before	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
burial	1
service	1
was	1
comic	1
what	1
about	1
poor	1
art	1
and	1
his	1
trouble	1
why	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
simply	1
breaking	1
just	1
so	1
said	1
he	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
transfusion	1
of	1
his	1
blood	1
to	1
her	1
veins	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
truly	1
his	1
bride	1
yes	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
comforting	1
idea	1
for	1
him	1
quite	1
so	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
difficulty	1
friend	1
john	1
if	1
so	1
that	1
then	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
others	1
ho	1
ho	1
there	1
this	1
so	1
sweet	1
maid	1
is	1
a	1
polyandrist	1
and	1
me	1
with	1
my	1
poor	1
wife	1
dead	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
alive	1
by	1
churchs	1
law	1
though	1
no	1
wits	1
all	1
gone	1
even	1
i	1
who	1
am	1
faithful	1
husband	1
to	1
this	1
nownowife	1
am	1
bigamist	1
i	1
dont	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
joke	1
comes	1
in	1
there	1
either	1
i	1
said	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
particularly	1
pleased	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
saying	1
such	1
things	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
said	1
friend	1
john	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
pain	1
i	1
showed	1
not	1
my	1
feeling	1
to	1
others	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
wound	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
whom	1
i	1
can	1
trust	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
looked	1
into	1
my	1
very	1
heart	1
then	1
when	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
laugh	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
laugh	1
arrived	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
do	1
so	1
now	1
when	1
king	1
laugh	1
have	1
pack	1
up	1
his	1
crown	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
go	1
far	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
long	1
time	1
maybe	1
you	1
would	1
perhaps	1
pity	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
i	1
was	1
touched	1
by	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
his	1
tone	1
and	1
asked	1
why	1
because	1
i	1
know	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
scattered	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
day	1
loneliness	1
will	1
sit	1
over	1
our	1
roofs	1
with	1
brooding	1
wings	1
lucy	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
her	1
kin	1
a	1
lordly	1
deathhouse	1
in	1
a	1
lonely	1
churchyard	1
away	1
from	1
teeming	1
london	1
where	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
fresh	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
rises	1
over	1
hampstead	1
hill	1
and	1
where	1
wild	1
flowers	1
grow	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord	1
so	1
i	1
can	1
finish	1
this	1
diary	1
and	1
god	1
only	1
knows	1
if	1
i	1
shall	1
ever	1
begin	1
another	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
or	1
i	1
i	1
even	1
open	1
this	1
again	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
different	1
people	1
and	1
different	1
themes	1
for	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
where	1
the	1
romance	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
told	1
ere	1
i	1
go	1
back	1

the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
hampstead	1
is	1
just	1
at	1
present	1
exercised	1
with	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
events	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
run	1
on	1
lines	1
parallel	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
writers	1
of	1
headlines	1
as	1
the	1
kensington	1

or	1
the	1

woman	1
in	1

during	1
the	1
past	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
several	1
cases	1
have	1
occurred	1
of	1
young	1
children	1
straying	1
from	1
home	1
or	1
neglecting	1
to	1
return	1
from	1
their	1
playing	1
on	1
the	1
heath	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
too	1
young	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
properly	1
intelligible	1
account	1
of	1
themselves	1
but	1
the	1
consensus	1
of	1
their	1
excuses	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
a	1
bloofer	1

it	1
has	1
always	1

on	1
two	1

found	1
until	1
early	1
in	1

is	1
generally	1
supposed	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
child	1
missed	1
gave	1
as	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
being	1
away	1
that	1
a	1
bloofer	1

had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
a	1

i	1

if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1

in	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
did	1
he	1
get	1
his	1

then	1
write	1
all	1
those	1

or	1
had	1
he	1
some	1
cause	1
for	1
it	1
all	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
for	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1

yesterday	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
certain	1
of	1
him	1
poor	1
fellow	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
funeral	1
upset	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
mind	1
back	1
on	1
some	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
believes	1
it	1
all	1
himself	1
i	1
remember	1
how	1
on	1
our	1

he	1
said	1

some	1
solemn	1

go	1

asleep	1

awake	1
mad	1

sane	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
some	1
thread	1
of	1
continuity	1
that	1
fearful	1
count	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
london	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1

he	1
came	1

with	1
his	1
teeming	1
millions	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1

and	1
if	1
it	1
come	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
shrink	1
from	1
it	1
i	1

shall	1

my	1

it	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
wants	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
she	1
knows	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
understand	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
did	1
right	1
in	1
not	1
saying	1
anything	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
mrs	1
westenra	1
i	1
should	1
never	1
forgive	1
myself	1
if	1
any	1
act	1
of	1
mine	1
were	1
it	1
even	1
a	1
negative	1
one	1
brought	1
harm	1
on	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucy	1
i	1
hope	1
too	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
will	1
not	1
blame	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
and	1
anxiety	1
of	1
late	1
that	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
more	1
just	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
suppose	1
a	1
cry	1
does	1
us	1
all	1
good	1
at	1
times	1
clears	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
other	1
rain	1
does	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
reading	1
the	1
journal	1
yesterday	1
that	1
upset	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
jonathan	1
went	1
away	1
this	1
morning	1
to	1
stay	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
parted	1
since	1
our	1
marriage	1
i	1
do	1
hope	1
the	1
dear	1
fellow	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
will	1
occur	1
to	1
upset	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
two	1
oclock	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
soon	1
now	1
i	1
shall	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
jonathans	1
journal	1
unless	1
he	1
asks	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
i	1
have	1
typewritten	1
out	1
my	1
own	1
journal	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
asks	1
about	1
lucy	1
i	1
can	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
save	1
much	1
questioning	1
later	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
gone	1
oh	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
meeting	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
makes	1
my	1
head	1
whirl	1
round	1
i	1
feel	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
possible	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
read	1
jonathans	1
journal	1
first	1
i	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
accepted	1
even	1
a	1
possibility	1
poor	1
poor	1
dear	1
jonathan	1
how	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
please	1
the	1
good	1
god	1
all	1
this	1
may	1
not	1
upset	1
him	1
again	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
even	1
a	1
consolation	1
and	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
him	1
terrible	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
and	1
awful	1
in	1
its	1
consequences	1
to	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
and	1
brain	1
did	1
not	1
deceive	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
true	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
doubt	1
which	1
haunts	1
him	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
doubt	1
is	1
removed	1
no	1
matter	1
which	1
waking	1
or	1
dreaming	1
may	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
satisfied	1
and	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
shock	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
clever	1
one	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
arthurs	1
friend	1
and	1
dr	1
sewards	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
holland	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
lucy	1
i	1
feel	1
from	1
having	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
noble	1
nature	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
jonathan	1
and	1
then	1
please	1
god	1
all	1
this	1
sorrow	1
and	1
anxiety	1
may	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
end	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
i	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
practice	1
interviewing	1
jonathans	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
exeter	1
news	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
memory	1
was	1
everything	1
in	1
such	1
work	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
exactly	1
almost	1
every	1
word	1
spoken	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
to	1
refine	1
some	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
rare	1
interview	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
record	1
it	1
verbatim	1
it	1
was	1
halfpast	1
two	1
oclock	1
when	1
the	1
knock	1
came	1
i	1
took	1
my	1
courage	1
a	1
deux	1
mains	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
mary	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
announced	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
rose	1
and	1
bowed	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
towards	1
me	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
weight	1
strongly	1
built	1
with	1
his	1
shoulders	1
set	1
back	1
over	1
a	1
broad	1
deep	1
chest	1
and	1
a	1
neck	1
well	1
balanced	1
on	1
the	1
trunk	1
as	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
neck	1
the	1
poise	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
strikes	1
one	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
indicative	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
power	1
the	1

is	1
noble	1
wellsized	1
broad	1

large	1
behind	1

large	1
resolute	1
mobile	1
mouth	1
a	1
goodsized	1
nose	1
rather	1
straight	1
but	1
with	1
quick	1
sensitive	1
nostrils	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
broaden	1
as	1
the	1
big	1
bushy	1
brows	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
tightens	1
the	1
forehead	1
is	1
broad	1
and	1
fine	1
rising	1
at	1
first	1
almost	1
straight	1
and	1
then	1
sloping	1
back	1
above	1
two	1
bumps	1
or	1
ridges	1
wide	1
apart	1
such	1
a	1
forehead	1
that	1
the	1
reddish	1
hair	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
tumble	1
over	1
it	1
but	1
falls	1
naturally	1
back	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
big	1
dark	1
blue	1
eyes	1
are	1
set	1
widely	1
apart	1

are	1
quick	1
and	1
tender	1
or	1
stern	1
with	1
the	1
mans	1
moods	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
mrs	1

come	1
sir	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
better	1
claim	1
on	1
me	1
than	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
helper	1
of	1
lucy	1
westenra	1
and	1
i	1
held	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
tenderly	1
oh	1
madam	1
mina	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
that	1
poor	1
lily	1
girl	1
must	1
be	1
good	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
yet	1
to	1
learn	1
he	1
finished	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
a	1
courtly	1
bow	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
about	1
so	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
letters	1
to	1
miss	1
lucy	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
inquire	1
somewhere	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
ask	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
whitby	1
she	1
sometimes	1
kept	1
a	1
diary	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
look	1
surprised	1
madam	1
mina	1
it	1
was	1
begun	1
after	1
you	1
had	1
left	1
and	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
diary	1
she	1
traces	1
by	1
inference	1
certain	1
things	1
to	1
a	1
sleepwalking	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
puts	1
down	1
that	1
you	1
saved	1
her	1
in	1
great	1
perplexity	1
then	1
i	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
ask	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
so	1
much	1
kindness	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
remember	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
i	1
think	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
ah	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
good	1
memory	1
for	1
facts	1
for	1
details	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
so	1
with	1
young	1
ladies	1
no	1
doctor	1
but	1
i	1
wrote	1
it	1
all	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
can	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
oh	1
madam	1
mina	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
grateful	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
much	1
favour	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
mystifying	1
him	1
a	1
bit	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
apple	1
that	1
remains	1
still	1
in	1
our	1
mouths	1
so	1
i	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
shorthand	1
diary	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
grateful	1
bow	1
and	1
said	1
may	1
i	1
read	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
i	1
answered	1
as	1
demurely	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
he	1
opened	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
face	1
fell	1
then	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
bowed	1
oh	1
you	1
so	1
clever	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
long	1
knew	1
that	1
mr	1
jonathan	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
much	1
thankfulness	1
but	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
and	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
honour	1
me	1
and	1
so	1
help	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
me	1
alas	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
shorthand	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
little	1
joke	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
so	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
typewritten	1
copy	1
from	1
my	1
workbasket	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
forgive	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
dear	1
lucy	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
wait	1
not	1
on	1
my	1
account	1
but	1
because	1
i	1
know	1
your	1
time	1
must	1
be	1
precious	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
typewriter	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
glistened	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
may	1
i	1
read	1
it	1
now	1
i	1
may	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
some	1
things	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
i	1
said	1
read	1
it	1
over	1
whilst	1
i	1
order	1
lunch	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
me	1
questions	1
whilst	1
we	1
eat	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
became	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
whilst	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
after	1
lunch	1
chiefly	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
disturbed	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
walking	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
his	1
face	1
all	1
ablaze	1
with	1
excitement	1
he	1
rushed	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
by	1
both	1
hands	1
oh	1
madam	1
mina	1
he	1
said	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
say	1
what	1
i	1
owe	1
to	1
you	1

i	1
saw	1
here	1
an	1
opening	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
jonathan	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
recovered	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
greatly	1
upset	1
by	1
mr	1
hawkinss	1
death	1
he	1
interrupted	1
oh	1

know	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
last	1
two	1
letters	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
suppose	1
this	1
upset	1
him	1
for	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
town	1
on	1
thursday	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shock	1
a	1
shock	1
and	1
after	1
brain	1
fever	1
so	1
soon	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
shock	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
recalled	1
something	1
terrible	1
something	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
his	1
brain	1
fever	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
seemed	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
rush	1
the	1
pity	1
for	1
jonathan	1
the	1
horror	1
which	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
whole	1
fearful	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
diary	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
brooding	1
over	1
me	1
ever	1
since	1
all	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
tumult	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
was	1
hysterical	1
for	1
i	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
held	1
up	1
my	1
hands	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
implored	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
husband	1
well	1
again	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
raised	1
me	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
sat	1
by	1
me	1
he	1
held	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
oh	1
such	1
infinite	1
sweetness	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
barren	1
and	1
lonely	1
one	1
and	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
work	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
much	1
time	1
for	1
friendships	1
but	1
since	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
summoned	1
to	1
here	1
by	1
my	1
friend	1
john	1
seward	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
so	1
many	1
good	1
people	1
and	1
seen	1
such	1
nobility	1
that	1
i	1
feel	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
grown	1
with	1
my	1
advancing	1
years	1
the	1
loneliness	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
believe	1
me	1
then	1
that	1
i	1
come	1
here	1
full	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
hope	1
hope	1
not	1
in	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
seeking	1
of	1
but	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
good	1
women	1
still	1
left	1
to	1
make	1
life	1
happy	1
good	1
women	1
whose	1
lives	1
and	1
whose	1
truths	1
may	1
make	1
good	1
lesson	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
glad	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
here	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
if	1

within	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
my	1
study	1
and	1
experience	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
will	1
gladly	1
do	1
all	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
i	1

all	1
to	1

and	1
manly	1
and	1

happy	1
one	1

eat	1
you	1
are	1
overwrought	1
and	1
perhaps	1
overanxious	1
husband	1
jonathan	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
so	1
pale	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
like	1
not	1
where	1
he	1
love	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
his	1

for	1
his	1
sake	1
you	1
must	1
eat	1
and	1
smile	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
lucy	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
lest	1
it	1
distress	1
i	1
shall	1
stay	1
in	1
exeter	1
tonight	1
for	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
much	1
over	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
thought	1
i	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
questions	1

to	1
speaking	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
learned	1
man	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
weak	1
fool	1
and	1
jonathan	1
a	1
madman	1
that	1
journal	1
is	1
all	1
so	1
strange	1
and	1
i	1
hesitated	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
i	1
trusted	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
is	1
so	1
queer	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
laugh	1
at	1
me	1
or	1
at	1
my	1
husband	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
yesterday	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fever	1
of	1
doubt	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
foolish	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
even	1
half	1
believed	1
some	1
very	1
strange	1
things	1
he	1
reassured	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
words	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
regarding	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
would	1
laugh	1

learned	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
any	1
ones	1
belief	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
strange	1

tried	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
open	1
mind	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
ordinary	1
things	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
could	1
close	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
strange	1
things	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
things	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
make	1

i	1
thought	1
never	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
this	1
diary	1
again	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
home	1
last	1
night	1
mina	1
had	1
supper	1
ready	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
supped	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
van	1
helsings	1

and	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
two	1

copied	1
out	1
and	1
of	1
how	1

she	1
has	1
been	1
about	1
me	1
she	1
showed	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
doctors	1
letter	1
that	1
all	1
i	1
wrote	1
down	1
was	1
true	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
new	1
man	1
of	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
that	1
knocked	1
me	1
over	1
i	1
felt	1
impotent	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
distrustful	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
has	1
succeeded	1
after	1
all	1
then	1
in	1
his	1
design	1
in	1
getting	1
to	1
london	1
and	1
it	1
was	1

got	1
younger	1
and	1
how	1
van	1
helsing	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
unmask	1
him	1
and	1
hunt	1
him	1
out	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
anything	1
like	1
what	1
mina	1

i	1
shall	1
call	1

the	1
hotel	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
over	1
he	1
was	1
i	1
think	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
introduced	1
myself	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
turned	1
my	1
face	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
sharp	1
scrutiny	1
but	1
madam	1
mina	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
ill	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
shock	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
funny	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
wife	1
called	1
madam	1
mina	1
by	1
this	1
kindly	1
strongfaced	1
old	1
man	1
i	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
ill	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
shock	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
cured	1
me	1
already	1
and	1
how	1
by	1
your	1
letter	1
to	1
mina	1
last	1
night	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
and	1
then	1
everything	1
took	1
a	1
hue	1
of	1
unreality	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
trust	1
even	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
senses	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
trust	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
keep	1
on	1
working	1
in	1
what	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
the	1
groove	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
the	1
groove	1
ceased	1
to	1
avail	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
mistrusted	1
myself	1
doctor	1
you	1
dont	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
doubt	1
everything	1
even	1
yourself	1
no	1
you	1
dont	1
you	1
couldnt	1
with	1
eyebrows	1
like	1
yours	1
he	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
and	1
laughed	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
physiognomist	1
i	1
learn	1
more	1
here	1
with	1
each	1
hour	1

am	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
to	1

oh	1
sir	1
you	1
will	1
pardon	1
praise	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
blessed	1
in	1
your	1
wife	1
i	1
would	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
praising	1
mina	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
so	1
i	1
simply	1
nodded	1
and	1
stood	1
silent	1
she	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
gods	1
women	1
fashioned	1
by	1
his	1

show	1
us	1
men	1
and	1
other	1
women	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
heaven	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
enter	1
and	1
that	1
its	1
light	1
can	1
be	1
here	1
on	1
earth	1
so	1
true	1
so	1
sweet	1

friends	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
lives	1

shook	1

and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
earnest	1
and	1
so	1
kind	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
quite	1
choky	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
said	1

him	1
to	1
the	1
station	1

we	1
were	1

at	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
train	1
to	1
start	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
them	1
over	1
his	1
eye	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
westminster	1
gazette	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
colour	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
quite	1
white	1
he	1
read	1
something	1
intently	1
groaning	1
to	1
himself	1
mein	1
gott	1
mein	1
gott	1
so	1
soon	1

he	1
remembered	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
whistle	1
blew	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
moved	1
off	1
this	1
recalled	1
him	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
calling	1
out	1

to	1
madam	1
mina	1
i	1

not	1
a	1
week	1
since	1

finis	1
and	1
yet	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
starting	1
fresh	1
again	1
or	1
rather	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
record	1
until	1
this	1
afternoon	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
done	1
renfield	1
had	1
become	1
to	1
all	1
intents	1
as	1
sane	1
as	1
he	1
ever	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
well	1
ahead	1
with	1
his	1
fly	1
business	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
started	1
in	1
the	1
spider	1
line	1
also	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
any	1
trouble	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
arthur	1
written	1
on	1
sunday	1
and	1
from	1
it	1

that	1
he	1
is	1
bearing	1
up	1
wonderfully	1
well	1
quincey	1
morris	1
is	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
help	1
for	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
a	1
bubbling	1
well	1
of	1
good	1
spirits	1
quincey	1
wrote	1
me	1
a	1
line	1
too	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
i	1
hear	1
that	1
arthur	1
is	1
beginning	1
to	1
recover	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
buoyancy	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
at	1
rest	1
as	1
for	1
myself	1
i	1
was	1
settling	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
work	1
with	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
fairly	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
wound	1
which	1
poor	1
lucy	1
left	1
on	1
me	1
was	1
becoming	1
cicatrised	1
everything	1
is	1
however	1
now	1
reopened	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
god	1
only	1
knows	1
i	1
have	1

he	1
will	1
only	1
let	1
out	1
enough	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
whet	1
curiosity	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
exeter	1
yesterday	1
and	1
stayed	1
there	1
all	1
night	1
today	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
almost	1
bounded	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
at	1
about	1
halfpast	1

into	1
my	1

what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
back	1
and	1
folded	1
his	1
arms	1
i	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
paper	1
for	1
i	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
paragraph	1
about	1
children	1
being	1
decoyed	1
away	1
at	1
hampstead	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
convey	1
much	1
to	1
me	1
until	1
i	1
reached	1
a	1
passage	1
where	1
it	1
described	1
small	1
punctured	1
wounds	1
on	1
their	1
throats	1
an	1
idea	1
struck	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
looked	1
up	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
poor	1
lucys	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
simply	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
cause	1
in	1
common	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
injured	1
her	1
has	1
injured	1
them	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
his	1
answer	1
that	1
is	1
true	1
indirectly	1
but	1
not	1
directly	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
professor	1
i	1
asked	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
inclined	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
seriousness	1
lightly	1
for	1
after	1
all	1
four	1
days	1
of	1
rest	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
burning	1
harrowing	1
anxiety	1
does	1
help	1
to	1
restore	1
ones	1
spirits	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
it	1
sobered	1
me	1
never	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
our	1
despair	1
about	1
poor	1
lucy	1
had	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
stern	1
tell	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
can	1
hazard	1
no	1
opinion	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
data	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
conjecture	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
friend	1
john	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
suspicion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
poor	1
lucy	1
died	1
of	1
not	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
hints	1
given	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
events	1
but	1
by	1
me	1
of	1
nervous	1
prostration	1
following	1
on	1
great	1
loss	1
or	1
waste	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
blood	1
lost	1
or	1
waste	1
i	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
he	1
stepped	1
over	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
me	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
you	1
are	1
clever	1
man	1
friend	1
john	1
you	1
reason	1
well	1
and	1
your	1
wit	1
is	1
bold	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
prejudiced	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
eyes	1
see	1
nor	1
your	1
ears	1
hear	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
outside	1
your	1
daily	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
account	1
to	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
which	1
you	1
cannot	1
understand	1
and	1
yet	1
which	1
are	1
that	1
some	1
people	1
see	1
things	1
that	1
others	1
cannot	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
old	1
and	1
new	1
which	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
contemplate	1
by	1
mens	1
eyes	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
or	1
think	1
they	1
know	1
some	1
things	1
which	1
other	1
men	1
have	1
told	1
them	1
ah	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
our	1
science	1
that	1
it	1
wants	1
to	1
explain	1
all	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
explain	1
not	1
then	1
it	1
says	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
explain	1
but	1
yet	1
we	1
see	1
around	1
us	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
new	1
beliefs	1
which	1
think	1
themselves	1
new	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
which	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
young	1
like	1
the	1
fine	1
ladies	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
i	1
suppose	1
now	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
corporeal	1
transference	1
no	1
nor	1
in	1
materialisation	1
no	1
nor	1
in	1
astral	1
bodies	1
no	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
thought	1
no	1
nor	1
in	1
hypnotism	1
yes	1
i	1
said	1
charcot	1
has	1
proved	1
that	1
pretty	1
well	1
he	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
then	1
you	1
are	1
satisfied	1
as	1
to	1
it	1
yes	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
then	1
you	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
act	1
and	1
can	1
follow	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
charcot	1
alas	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
that	1
he	1
influence	1
no	1
then	1
friend	1
john	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
simply	1
accept	1
fact	1
and	1
are	1
satisfied	1
to	1
let	1
from	1
premise	1
to	1
conclusion	1
be	1
a	1
blank	1
no	1
then	1
tell	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
student	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
how	1
you	1
accept	1
the	1
hypnotism	1
and	1
reject	1
the	1
thought	1
reading	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
done	1
today	1
in	1
electrical	1
science	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
deemed	1
unholy	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
who	1
discovered	1
electricity	1
who	1
would	1
themselves	1
not	1
so	1
long	1
before	1
have	1
been	1
burned	1
as	1
wizards	1
there	1
are	1

poor	1
lucy	1
with	1
four	1

in	1
her	1
poor	1

you	1
know	1
the	1
altogether	1
of	1
comparative	1
anatomy	1
and	1

wherefore	1
the	1
qualities	1
of	1
brutes	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
men	1
and	1
not	1

can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
when	1
other	1
spiders	1
die	1
small	1
and	1
soon	1
that	1
one	1
great	1
spider	1
lived	1
for	1
centuries	1
in	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
spanish	1
church	1

he	1
could	1
drink	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
church	1
lamps	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
in	1
the	1
pampas	1
ay	1
and	1
elsewhere	1
there	1
are	1
bats	1
that	1
come	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
veins	1
of	1
cattle	1
and	1
horses	1
and	1
suck	1
dry	1
their	1
veins	1
how	1
in	1
some	1
islands	1
of	1
the	1
western	1
seas	1
there	1
are	1
bats	1
which	1
hang	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
all	1
day	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
describe	1
as	1
like	1
giant	1
nuts	1
or	1
pods	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
sailors	1
sleep	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
because	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
hot	1
flit	1
down	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
are	1
found	1
dead	1
men	1
white	1
as	1
even	1
miss	1
lucy	1
was	1
good	1
god	1
professor	1
i	1
said	1
starting	1
up	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
lucy	1
was	1
bitten	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
bat	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
here	1
in	1
london	1
in	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
silence	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
the	1
tortoise	1
lives	1
more	1
long	1
than	1
generations	1
of	1
men	1
why	1
the	1
elephant	1
goes	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
have	1
seen	1
dynasties	1
and	1
why	1
the	1
parrot	1
never	1
die	1
only	1
of	1
bite	1
of	1
cat	1
or	1
dog	1
or	1
other	1
complaint	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
men	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
ages	1
and	1
places	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
few	1
who	1
live	1
on	1
always	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
permit	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
who	1
cannot	1
die	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
because	1
science	1
has	1
vouched	1
for	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
toads	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
rocks	1
for	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
shut	1
in	1
one	1
so	1
small	1
hole	1
that	1
only	1
hold	1
him	1
since	1
the	1
youth	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
the	1
indian	1
fakir	1
make	1
himself	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
buried	1
and	1
his	1
grave	1
sealed	1
and	1
corn	1
sowed	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
corn	1
reaped	1
and	1
be	1
cut	1
and	1
sown	1
and	1
reaped	1
and	1
cut	1
again	1
and	1
then	1
men	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
unbroken	1
seal	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
lie	1
the	1
indian	1
fakir	1
not	1
dead	1
but	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk	1
amongst	1
them	1
as	1
before	1
here	1
i	1
interrupted	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
getting	1
bewildered	1
he	1
so	1
crowded	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
his	1
list	1
of	1
natures	1
eccentricities	1
and	1
possible	1
impossibilities	1
that	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
getting	1
fired	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
dim	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
me	1
some	1
lesson	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
at	1
amsterdam	1
but	1
he	1
used	1
then	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
thing	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
thought	1
in	1
mind	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
was	1
without	1
this	1
help	1
yet	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
professor	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
your	1
pet	1
student	1
again	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
thesis	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
apply	1
your	1
knowledge	1
as	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
from	1
point	1
to	1
point	1
as	1
a	1
mad	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
sane	1
one	1
follows	1
an	1
idea	1
i	1
feel	1
like	1
a	1
novice	1
blundering	1
through	1
a	1
bog	1
in	1
a	1
mist	1
jumping	1
from	1
one	1
tussock	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
blind	1
effort	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
without	1
knowing	1
where	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
image	1
he	1
said	1
well	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
thesis	1
is	1
this	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
let	1
me	1
illustrate	1
i	1
heard	1
once	1
of	1
an	1
american	1
who	1
so	1
defined	1
faith	1
that	1
faculty	1
which	1
enables	1
us	1
to	1
believe	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
untrue	1
for	1
one	1
i	1
follow	1
that	1
man	1
he	1
meant	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
open	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
truth	1
check	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
truth	1
like	1
a	1
small	1
rock	1
does	1
a	1
railway	1
truck	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
small	1
truth	1
first	1
good	1
we	1
keep	1
him	1
and	1
we	1
value	1
him	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
think	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
then	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
some	1
previous	1
conviction	1
injure	1
the	1
receptivity	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
some	1
strange	1
matter	1
do	1
i	1
read	1
your	1
lesson	1
aright	1
ah	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
favourite	1
pupil	1
still	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
understand	1
you	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
understand	1
you	1
think	1
then	1
that	1
those	1
so	1
small	1
holes	1
in	1
the	1
childrens	1
throats	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
hole	1
in	1
miss	1
lucy	1
i	1
suppose	1
so	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
solemnly	1
then	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
oh	1
would	1
it	1
were	1
so	1
but	1
alas	1

i	1
cried	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
despairing	1
gesture	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1

for	1
a	1
while	1
sheer	1
anger	1
mastered	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
during	1
her	1
life	1
struck	1
lucy	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
i	1
smote	1
the	1
table	1
hard	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
are	1
you	1
mad	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
somehow	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
calmed	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
would	1

were	1
easy	1
to	1

compared	1
with	1
truth	1
like	1
this	1
oh	1
my	1
friend	1
why	1
think	1
you	1
did	1
i	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
round	1
why	1
take	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
thing	1
was	1
it	1
because	1
i	1
hate	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
hated	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
was	1
it	1
because	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
pain	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
wanted	1
now	1
so	1
late	1
revenge	1
for	1
that	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
saved	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
fearful	1
death	1
ah	1
no	1
forgive	1
me	1
said	1
i	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
my	1
friend	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
gentle	1
in	1
the	1
breaking	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
have	1
loved	1
that	1
so	1
sweet	1
lady	1
but	1
even	1
yet	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
accept	1
at	1
once	1
any	1
abstract	1
truth	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
doubt	1
such	1
to	1
be	1
possible	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
always	1
believed	1
the	1
no	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
hard	1
still	1
to	1
accept	1
so	1
sad	1
a	1
concrete	1
truth	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
miss	1
lucy	1
tonight	1
i	1
go	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
dare	1
you	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
this	1
staggered	1
me	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
prove	1
such	1
a	1
truth	1
byron	1
excepted	1
from	1
the	1
category	1
jealousy	1
and	1
prove	1
the	1
very	1
truth	1
he	1
most	1
abhorred	1
he	1
saw	1
my	1
hesitation	1
and	1
spoke	1
the	1

tussock	1
in	1
a	1
misty	1
bog	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
true	1
then	1
proof	1
will	1
be	1
relief	1
at	1
worst	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
harm	1
if	1
it	1

ah	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
dread	1
yet	1
very	1
dread	1
should	1
help	1
my	1
cause	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
need	1
of	1
belief	1
come	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
i	1
propose	1
first	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
off	1
now	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
dr	1
vincent	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
hospital	1
where	1
the	1
papers	1
say	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
is	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
yours	1
since	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
class	1
at	1
amsterdam	1
he	1
will	1
let	1
two	1
scientists	1
see	1
his	1
case	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
two	1
friends	1
we	1
shall	1
tell	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
only	1
that	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
key	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
in	1
the	1
churchyard	1
where	1
lucy	1
lies	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
key	1
that	1
lock	1
the	1
tomb	1
i	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
coffinman	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
arthur	1
my	1
heart	1
sank	1
within	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
fearful	1
ordeal	1
before	1
us	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
however	1
so	1
i	1
plucked	1
up	1
what	1
heart	1
i	1
could	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
hasten	1
as	1
the	1
afternoon	1
was	1
passing	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
child	1
awake	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
sleep	1
and	1
taken	1
some	1
food	1
and	1
altogether	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
well	1
dr	1
vincent	1
took	1
the	1
bandage	1
from	1
its	1
throat	1
and	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
punctures	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
the	1
similarity	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
lucys	1
throat	1
they	1
were	1
smaller	1
and	1
the	1
edges	1
looked	1
fresher	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
we	1
asked	1
vincent	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
attributed	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
bite	1
of	1
some	1
animal	1
perhaps	1
a	1
rat	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
he	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bats	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
numerous	1
on	1
the	1
northern	1
heights	1
of	1
london	1
out	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
harmless	1
ones	1
he	1
said	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
sonic	1
wild	1
specimen	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
malignant	1
species	1
some	1
sailor	1
may	1
have	1
brought	1
one	1
home	1
and	1
it	1
managed	1
to	1
escape	1
or	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
zoological	1
gardens	1
a	1
young	1
one	1
may	1
have	1
got	1
loose	1
or	1
one	1
be	1
bred	1
there	1
from	1
a	1
vampire	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
occur	1
you	1
know	1
only	1
ten	1
days	1
ago	1
a	1
wolf	1
got	1
out	1
and	1
was	1
i	1
believe	1
traced	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
playing	1
nothing	1
but	1
red	1
riding	1
hood	1
on	1
the	1
heath	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
alley	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
until	1
this	1
bloofer	1
lady	1
scare	1
came	1
along	1
since	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
quite	1
a	1
galatime	1
with	1
them	1
even	1
this	1
poor	1
little	1
mite	1
when	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
today	1
asked	1
the	1
nurse	1
if	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
away	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
bloofer	1
lady	1
i	1
hope	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
sending	1
the	1
child	1
home	1
you	1
will	1
caution	1
its	1
parents	1
to	1
keep	1
strict	1
watch	1
over	1
it	1
these	1
fancies	1
to	1
stray	1
are	1
most	1
dangerous	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
child	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
out	1
another	1
night	1
it	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
fatal	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
it	1
away	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
certainly	1
not	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
least	1
longer	1
if	1
the	1
wound	1
is	1
not	1
healed	1
our	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
took	1
more	1
time	1
than	1
we	1
had	1
reckoned	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
dipped	1
before	1
we	1
came	1
out	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
saw	1
how	1
dark	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
said	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hurry	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
late	1
than	1
i	1
thought	1
come	1
let	1
us	1
seek	1
somewhere	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
we	1
dined	1
at	1
jack	1
straws	1
castle	1
along	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
crowd	1
of	1
bicyclists	1
and	1
others	1
who	1
were	1
genially	1
noisy	1
about	1
ten	1
oclock	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
the	1
inn	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
very	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
scattered	1
lamps	1
made	1
the	1
darkness	1
greater	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
once	1
outside	1
their	1
individual	1
radius	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
evidently	1
noted	1
the	1
road	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
unhesitatingly	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
mixup	1
as	1
to	1
locality	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
further	1
we	1
met	1
fewer	1
and	1
fewer	1
people	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
we	1
were	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
even	1
the	1
patrol	1
of	1
horse	1
police	1
going	1
their	1
usual	1
suburban	1
round	1
at	1
last	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
which	1
we	1
climbed	1
over	1
with	1
some	1
little	1
difficulty	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
seemed	1
so	1
strange	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
westenra	1
tomb	1
the	1
professor	1
took	1
the	1
key	1
opened	1
the	1
creaky	1
door	1
and	1
standing	1
back	1
politely	1
but	1
quite	1
unconsciously	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
precede	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
delicious	1
irony	1
in	1
the	1
offer	1
in	1
the	1
courtliness	1
of	1
giving	1
preference	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
ghastly	1
occasion	1
my	1
companion	1
followed	1
me	1
quickly	1
and	1
cautiously	1
drew	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
after	1
carefully	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
the	1
lock	1
was	1
a	1
falling	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
spring	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
case	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
plight	1
then	1
he	1
fumbled	1
in	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
matchbox	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
candle	1
proceeded	1
to	1
make	1

tomb	1
in	1
the	1
daytime	1
and	1
when	1
wreathed	1
with	1
fresh	1
flowers	1
had	1
looked	1
grim	1
and	1
gruesome	1
enough	1
but	1
now	1
some	1
days	1
afterwards	1
when	1
the	1
flowers	1
hung	1
lank	1
and	1
dead	1
their	1
whites	1
turning	1
to	1
rust	1
and	1
their	1
greens	1
to	1
browns	1
when	1
the	1
spider	1
and	1
the	1
beetle	1
had	1
resumed	1
their	1
accustomed	1
dominance	1
when	1

and	1
rusty	1
dank	1
iron	1
and	1
tarnished	1
brass	1
and	1
clouded	1
silverplating	1
gave	1
back	1
the	1
feeble	1
glimmer	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
more	1
miserable	1
and	1
sordid	1
than	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
imagined	1
it	1
conveyed	1
irresistibly	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
life	1
animal	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
which	1
could	1
pass	1
away	1
van	1
helsing	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
work	1
systematically	1
holding	1
his	1
candle	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
read	1
the	1
coffin	1
plates	1
and	1
so	1
holding	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
dropped	1
in	1
white	1
patches	1
which	1
congealed	1
as	1
they	1
touched	1
the	1
metal	1
he	1
made	1
assurance	1
of	1
lucys	1
coffin	1
another	1
search	1
in	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
turnscrew	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
asked	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
coffin	1
you	1
shall	1
yet	1
be	1
convinced	1
straightway	1
he	1
began	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
screws	1
and	1
finally	1
lifted	1
off	1
the	1
lid	1
showing	1
the	1
casing	1
of	1
lead	1
beneath	1
the	1
sight	1
was	1
almost	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
an	1
affront	1
to	1
the	1
dead	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
have	1
stripped	1
off	1
her	1
clothing	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
whilst	1
living	1
i	1
actually	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
he	1
only	1
said	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
again	1
fumbling	1
in	1
his	1
bag	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
tiny	1
fretsaw	1
striking	1
the	1
turnscrew	1
through	1
the	1
lead	1
with	1
a	1
swift	1
downward	1
stab	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
wince	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
small	1
hole	1
which	1
was	1
however	1
big	1
enough	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
saw	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
gas	1
from	1
the	1
weekold	1
corpse	1
we	1
doctors	1
who	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
study	1
our	1
dangers	1
have	1
to	1
become	1
accustomed	1
to	1
such	1
things	1
and	1
i	1
drew	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
the	1
professor	1
never	1
stopped	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
sawed	1
down	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
feet	1
along	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lead	1
coffin	1
and	1
then	1
across	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
taking	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
loose	1
flange	1
he	1
bent	1
it	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
coffin	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
candle	1
into	1
the	1
aperture	1
motioned	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
i	1
drew	1
near	1
and	1
looked	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
empty	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
a	1
surprise	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
considerable	1
shock	1
but	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
unmoved	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
sure	1
than	1
ever	1
of	1
his	1
ground	1
and	1
so	1
emboldened	1
to	1
proceed	1
in	1
his	1
task	1
are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
now	1
friend	1
john	1
he	1
asked	1
i	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
dogged	1
argumentativeness	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
awake	1
within	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
answered	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
satisfied	1
that	1
lucys	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
coffin	1
but	1
that	1
only	1
proves	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
friend	1
john	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
there	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
logic	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes	1
but	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
account	1
for	1
it	1
not	1
being	1
there	1
perhaps	1
a	1
bodysnatcher	1
i	1
suggested	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
undertakers	1
people	1
may	1
have	1
stolen	1
it	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
speaking	1
folly	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
cause	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
suggest	1
the	1
professor	1
sighed	1
ah	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
more	1
proof	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
coffinlid	1
again	1
gathered	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
things	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
bag	1
blew	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
placed	1
the	1
candle	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
bag	1
we	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
behind	1
us	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
the	1
key	1
saying	1
will	1
you	1
keep	1
it	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
assured	1
i	1
laughed	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
cheerful	1
laugh	1
i	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
i	1
motioned	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
key	1
is	1
nothing	1
i	1
said	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
duplicates	1
and	1
anyhow	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
pick	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
put	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
then	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
watch	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
whilst	1
he	1
would	1
watch	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
i	1
took	1
up	1
my	1
place	1
behind	1
a	1
yewtree	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
his	1
dark	1
figure	1
move	1
until	1
the	1
intervening	1
headstones	1
and	1
trees	1
hid	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lonely	1
vigil	1
just	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
taken	1
my	1
place	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
distant	1
clock	1
strike	1
twelve	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
came	1
one	1
and	1
two	1
i	1
was	1
chilled	1
and	1
unnerved	1
and	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
for	1
taking	1
me	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
errand	1
and	1
with	1
myself	1
for	1
coming	1
i	1
was	1
too	1
cold	1
and	1
too	1
sleepy	1
to	1
be	1
keenly	1
observant	1
and	1
not	1
sleepy	1
enough	1
to	1
betray	1
my	1
trust	1
so	1
altogether	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
dreary	1
miserable	1
time	1
suddenly	1
as	1
i	1
turned	1
round	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
saw	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
streak	1
moving	1
between	1
two	1
dark	1
yewtrees	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
farthest	1
from	1
the	1
tomb	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
a	1
dark	1
mass	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
professors	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
went	1
towards	1
it	1
then	1
i	1
too	1
moved	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
headstones	1
and	1
railedoff	1
tombs	1
and	1
i	1
stumbled	1
over	1
graves	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
overcast	1
and	1
somewhere	1
far	1
off	1
an	1
early	1
cock	1
crew	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
off	1
beyond	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
scattered	1
junipertrees	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
pathway	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
a	1
white	1
dim	1
figure	1
flitted	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
the	1
tomb	1
itself	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
trees	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
figure	1
disappeared	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
actual	1
movement	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
and	1
coming	1
over	1
found	1
the	1
professor	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
a	1
tiny	1
child	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
now	1
no	1
i	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
was	1
aggressive	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
child	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
child	1
but	1
who	1
brought	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
is	1
it	1
wounded	1
i	1
asked	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
impulse	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
churchyard	1
he	1
carrying	1
the	1
sleeping	1
child	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
got	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
away	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
and	1
struck	1
a	1
match	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
childs	1
throat	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
a	1
scratch	1
or	1
scar	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
was	1
i	1
right	1
i	1
asked	1
triumphantly	1
we	1
were	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
thankfully	1
we	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
decide	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
so	1
consulted	1
about	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
policestation	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
our	1
movements	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
statement	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
child	1
so	1
finally	1
we	1
decided	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
heath	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
a	1
policeman	1
coming	1
would	1
leave	1
it	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
we	1
would	1
then	1
seek	1
our	1
way	1
home	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
all	1
fell	1
out	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
hampstead	1
heath	1
we	1
heard	1
a	1
policemans	1
heavy	1
tramp	1
and	1
laying	1
the	1
child	1
on	1
the	1
pathway	1
we	1
waited	1
and	1
watched	1
until	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
flashed	1
his	1
lantern	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
we	1
heard	1
his	1
exclamation	1
of	1
astonishment	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
went	1
away	1
silently	1
by	1
good	1
chance	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
cab	1
near	1
the	1
spaniards	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
town	1
i	1
cannot	1
sleep	1
so	1
i	1
make	1
this	1
entry	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
sleep	1
as	1
van	1
helsing	1
is	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
noon	1
he	1
insists	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
another	1
expedition	1
27	1
september	1
it	1
was	1
two	1
oclock	1
before	1
we	1
found	1
a	1
suitable	1
opportunity	1
for	1
our	1
attempt	1
the	1
funeral	1
held	1
at	1
noon	1
was	1
all	1
completed	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
stragglers	1
of	1
the	1
mourners	1
had	1
taken	1
themselves	1
lazily	1
away	1
when	1
looking	1
carefully	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
aldertrees	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
sexton	1
lock	1
the	1
gate	1
after	1
him	1
we	1
knew	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
safe	1
till	1
morning	1
did	1
we	1
desire	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
professor	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
want	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
most	1
again	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
horrid	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
which	1
any	1
effort	1
of	1
imagination	1
seemed	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
and	1
i	1
realised	1
distinctly	1
the	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
incurring	1
in	1
our	1
unhallowed	1
work	1
besides	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
useless	1
outrageous	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
open	1
a	1
leaden	1
coffin	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
dead	1
nearly	1
a	1
week	1
were	1
really	1
dead	1
it	1
now	1
seemed	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
folly	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
tomb	1
again	1
when	1
we	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
eyesight	1
that	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
empty	1
i	1
shrugged	1
my	1
shoulders	1
however	1
and	1
rested	1
silent	1
for	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
going	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
road	1
no	1
matter	1
who	1
remonstrated	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
key	1
opened	1
the	1
vault	1
and	1
again	1
courteously	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
precede	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
gruesome	1
as	1
last	1
night	1
but	1
oh	1
how	1
unutterably	1
meanlooking	1
when	1
the	1
sunshine	1
streamed	1
in	1
van	1
helsing	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
lucys	1
coffin	1
and	1
i	1
followed	1
he	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
again	1
forced	1
back	1
the	1
leaden	1
flange	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
dismay	1
shot	1
through	1
me	1
there	1
lay	1
lucy	1
seemingly	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
her	1
funeral	1
she	1
was	1
if	1
possible	1
more	1
radiantly	1
beautiful	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
red	1
nay	1
redder	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
cheeks	1
was	1
a	1
delicate	1
bloom	1
is	1
this	1
a	1
juggle	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
are	1
you	1
convinced	1
now	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
response	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
put	1
over	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
pulled	1
back	1
the	1
dead	1
lips	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
white	1
teeth	1
see	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
see	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
sharper	1
than	1
before	1
with	1
this	1
and	1
this	1
and	1
he	1
touched	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
canine	1
teeth	1
and	1
that	1
below	1
it	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
can	1
be	1
bitten	1
are	1
you	1
of	1
belief	1
now	1
friend	1
john	1
once	1
more	1
argumentative	1
hostility	1
woke	1
within	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
accept	1
such	1
an	1
overwhelming	1
idea	1
as	1
he	1
suggested	1
so	1
with	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
argue	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
ashamed	1
i	1
said	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
placed	1
here	1
since	1
last	1
night	1
indeed	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
some	1
one	1
has	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
dead	1
one	1
week	1
most	1
peoples	1
in	1
that	1
time	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
so	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
answer	1
for	1
this	1
so	1
was	1
silent	1
van	1
helsing	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
notice	1
my	1
silence	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
showed	1
neither	1
chagrin	1
nor	1
triumph	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
woman	1
raising	1
the	1
eyelids	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
opening	1
the	1
lips	1
and	1
examining	1
the	1
teeth	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
here	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
different	1
from	1
all	1
recorded	1
here	1
is	1
some	1
dual	1
life	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
common	1
she	1
was	1
bitten	1
by	1
the	1
vampire	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
sleepwalking	1
oh	1
you	1
start	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
friend	1
john	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
later	1
and	1
in	1
trance	1
could	1
he	1
best	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
more	1
blood	1
in	1
trance	1
she	1
died	1
and	1
in	1
trance	1
she	1
is	1
undead	1
too	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
differ	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
usually	1
when	1
the	1
undead	1
sleep	1
at	1
home	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
comprehensive	1
sweep	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
designate	1
what	1
to	1
a	1
vampire	1
was	1
home	1
their	1
face	1
show	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
this	1
so	1
sweet	1
that	1
was	1
when	1
she	1
not	1
undead	1
she	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
nothings	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
dead	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
malign	1
there	1
see	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
make	1
hard	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
kill	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
this	1
turned	1
my	1
blood	1
cold	1
and	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
accepting	1
van	1
helsings	1
theories	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
really	1
dead	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
of	1
terror	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
killing	1
her	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
evidently	1
saw	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
almost	1
joyously	1
ah	1
you	1
believe	1
now	1
i	1
answered	1
do	1
not	1
press	1
me	1
too	1
hard	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
accept	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
this	1
bloody	1
work	1
i	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
fill	1
her	1
mouth	1
with	1
garlic	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
drive	1
a	1
stake	1
through	1
her	1
body	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
so	1
mutilating	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
loved	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
feeling	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
strong	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
beginning	1
to	1
shudder	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
this	1
being	1
this	1
undead	1
as	1
van	1
helsing	1
called	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
loathe	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
love	1
is	1
all	1
subjective	1
or	1
all	1
objective	1
i	1
waited	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
for	1
van	1
helsing	1
to	1
begin	1
but	1
he	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
wrapped	1
in	1
thought	1
presently	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
catch	1
of	1
his	1
bag	1
with	1
a	1
snap	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
simply	1
follow	1
my	1
inclining	1
i	1
would	1
do	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
things	1
to	1
follow	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
difficult	1
in	1
that	1
them	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
is	1
simple	1
she	1
have	1
yet	1
no	1
life	1
taken	1
though	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
to	1
act	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
take	1
danger	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
ever	1
but	1
then	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
want	1
arthur	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
if	1
you	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
wounds	1
on	1
lucys	1
throat	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
wounds	1
so	1
similar	1
on	1
the	1
childs	1
at	1
the	1
hospital	1
if	1
you	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
coffin	1
empty	1
last	1
night	1
and	1
full	1
today	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
change	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
rose	1
and	1
more	1
beautiful	1
in	1
a	1
whole	1
week	1
after	1
she	1
die	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
the	1
churchyard	1
and	1
yet	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
senses	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
how	1
then	1
can	1
i	1
expect	1
arthur	1
who	1
know	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
to	1
believe	1
he	1
doubted	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
took	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
kiss	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
dying	1
i	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
forgiven	1
me	1
because	1
in	1
some	1
mistaken	1
idea	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
things	1
that	1
prevent	1
him	1
say	1
goodbye	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
and	1
he	1
may	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
more	1
mistaken	1
idea	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
buried	1
alive	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
most	1
mistake	1
of	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
killed	1
her	1
he	1
will	1
then	1
argue	1
back	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
mistaken	1
ones	1
that	1
have	1
killed	1
her	1
by	1
our	1
ideas	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
unhappy	1
always	1
yet	1
he	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
sometimes	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
he	1
loved	1
was	1
buried	1
alive	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
paint	1
his	1
dreams	1
with	1
horrors	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
so	1
beloved	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
an	1
undead	1
no	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
once	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
i	1
learn	1
much	1
now	1
since	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
true	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
bitter	1
waters	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
sweet	1
he	1
poor	1
fellow	1
must	1
have	1
one	1
hour	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
very	1
face	1
of	1
heaven	1
grow	1
black	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
we	1
can	1
act	1
for	1
good	1
all	1
round	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
peace	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
you	1
return	1
home	1
for	1
tonight	1
to	1

and	1
see	1
that	1
all	1

well	1
as	1

me	1
i	1
shall	1

came	1
away	1
and	1

over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1

this	1
in	1
case	1
anything	1
should	1
happen	1
i	1
go	1
alone	1
to	1
watch	1
in	1
that	1
churchyard	1
it	1
pleases	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
undead	1
miss	1
lucy	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
tonight	1
that	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
night	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
eager	1
therefore	1
i	1
shall	1
fix	1
some	1
things	1
she	1
like	1
not	1
garlic	1
and	1
a	1
crucifix	1
and	1
so	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
she	1
is	1
young	1
as	1
undead	1
and	1
will	1
heed	1
moreover	1
these	1
are	1
only	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
coming	1
out	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
her	1
wanting	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
for	1
then	1
the	1
undead	1
is	1
desperate	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
least	1
resistance	1
whatsoever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
hand	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
from	1
sunset	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
sunrise	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
aught	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
learned	1
i	1
shall	1
learn	1
it	1
for	1
miss	1
lucy	1
or	1
from	1
her	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
but	1
that	1
other	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
undead	1
he	1
have	1
now	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
seek	1
her	1
tomb	1
and	1
find	1
shelter	1
he	1
is	1
cunning	1
as	1
i	1
know	1
from	1
mr	1
jonathan	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
all	1
along	1
he	1
have	1
fooled	1
us	1
when	1
he	1
played	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
miss	1
lucys	1
life	1
and	1
we	1
lost	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
ways	1
the	1
undead	1
are	1
strong	1
he	1
have	1
always	1
the	1
strength	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
of	1
twenty	1
men	1
even	1
we	1
four	1
who	1
gave	1
our	1
strength	1
to	1
miss	1
lucy	1
it	1
also	1
is	1
all	1
to	1
him	1
besides	1
he	1
can	1
summon	1
his	1
wolf	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
so	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
come	1
thither	1
on	1
this	1
night	1
he	1
shall	1
find	1
me	1
but	1
none	1
other	1
shall	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
attempt	1
the	1
place	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
his	1
hunting	1
ground	1
is	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
game	1
than	1
the	1
churchyard	1
where	1
the	1
undead	1
woman	1
sleep	1
and	1
one	1
old	1
man	1
watch	1
therefore	1
i	1
write	1
this	1
in	1
case	1
take	1
the	1
papers	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
this	1
the	1
diaries	1
of	1
harker	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
read	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
find	1
this	1
great	1
undead	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
burn	1
his	1
heart	1
or	1
drive	1
a	1
stake	1
through	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
the	1

may	1
rest	1
from	1

28	1
september	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
nights	1
sleep	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
one	1
yesterday	1
i	1
was	1
almost	1
willing	1
to	1
accept	1
van	1
helsings	1
monstrous	1
ideas	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
start	1
out	1
lurid	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
outrages	1
on	1
common	1
sense	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
believes	1
it	1
all	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
his	1
mind	1
can	1
have	1
become	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
unhinged	1
surely	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
rational	1
explanation	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
mysterious	1
things	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
professor	1
can	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
himself	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
abnormally	1
clever	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
would	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
intent	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
some	1
fixed	1
idea	1
in	1
a	1
wonderful	1
way	1
i	1
am	1
loath	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
and	1
indeed	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
marvel	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
mad	1
but	1
anyhow	1
i	1
shall	1
watch	1
him	1
carefully	1
i	1
may	1
get	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
mystery	1

september	1
morning	1
last	1
night	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
ten	1
oclock	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
came	1
into	1
van	1
helsings	1
room	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
especially	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
arthur	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
our	1
wills	1
were	1
centered	1
in	1
his	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
hoped	1
we	1
would	1
all	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
too	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
grave	1
duty	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
there	1
you	1
were	1
doubtless	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
letter	1
this	1
query	1
was	1
directly	1
addressed	1
to	1
lord	1
godalming	1
i	1
was	1
it	1
rather	1
upset	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
bit	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
around	1
my	1
house	1
of	1
late	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
without	1
any	1
more	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
curious	1
too	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
quincey	1
and	1
i	1
talked	1
it	1
over	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
we	1
talked	1
the	1
more	1
puzzled	1
we	1
got	1
till	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
myself	1
that	1
im	1
about	1
up	1
a	1
tree	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
meaning	1
about	1
anything	1
me	1
too	1
said	1
quincey	1
morris	1
laconically	1
oh	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
then	1
you	1
are	1
nearer	1
the	1
beginning	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
than	1
friend	1
john	1
here	1
who	1
has	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
back	1
before	1
he	1
can	1
even	1
get	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
begin	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
recognised	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
doubting	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
without	1
my	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
intense	1
gravity	1
i	1
want	1
your	1
permission	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
good	1
this	1
night	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
know	1
much	1
to	1
ask	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
how	1
much	1
therefore	1
may	1
i	1
ask	1
that	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
so	1
that	1
afterwards	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
disguise	1
from	1
myself	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
such	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
blame	1
yourselves	1
for	1
anything	1
thats	1
frank	1
anyhow	1
broke	1
in	1
quincey	1
ill	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
i	1
dont	1
quite	1
see	1
his	1
drift	1
but	1
i	1
swear	1
hes	1
honest	1
and	1
thats	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
sir	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
proudly	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
myself	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
counting	1
you	1
one	1
trusting	1
friend	1
and	1
such	1
endorsement	1
is	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
a	1
hand	1
which	1
quincey	1
took	1
then	1
arthur	1
spoke	1
out	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
dont	1
quite	1
like	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
pig	1
in	1
a	1
poke	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
scotland	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
anything	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
honour	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman	1
or	1
my	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
christian	1
is	1
concerned	1
i	1
cannot	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
promise	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
assure	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
intend	1
does	1
not	1
violate	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
then	1
i	1
give	1
my	1
consent	1
at	1
once	1
though	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
driving	1
at	1
i	1
accept	1
your	1
limitation	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
all	1
i	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
condemn	1
any	1
act	1
of	1
mine	1
you	1
will	1
first	1
consider	1
it	1
well	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
violate	1
your	1
reservations	1
agreed	1
said	1
arthur	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
fair	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
pourparlers	1
are	1
over	1
may	1
i	1
ask	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
secret	1
to	1
the	1
churchyard	1
at	1
kingstead	1
arthurs	1
face	1
fell	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
amazed	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
where	1
poor	1
lucy	1
is	1
buried	1
the	1
professor	1
bowed	1
arthur	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
when	1
there	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
tomb	1
arthur	1
stood	1
up	1
professor	1
are	1
you	1
in	1
earnest	1
or	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
monstrous	1
joke	1
pardon	1
me	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
earnest	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
firmly	1
and	1
proudly	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
on	1
his	1
dignity	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
until	1
he	1
asked	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
tomb	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
coffin	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
rising	1
again	1
i	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
be	1
patient	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
reasonable	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
this	1
desecration	1
of	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
he	1
fairly	1
choked	1
with	1
indignation	1
the	1
professor	1
looked	1
pityingly	1
at	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
spare	1
you	1
one	1
pang	1
my	1
poor	1
friend	1
he	1
said	1
god	1
knows	1
i	1
would	1
but	1
this	1
night	1
our	1
feet	1
must	1
tread	1
in	1
thorny	1
paths	1
or	1
later	1
and	1
for	1
ever	1
the	1
feet	1
you	1
love	1
must	1
walk	1
in	1
paths	1
of	1
flame	1
arthur	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
set	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
said	1
take	1
care	1
sir	1
take	1
care	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
know	1
the	1
limit	1
of	1
my	1
purpose	1
shall	1
i	1
go	1
on	1
thats	1
fair	1
enough	1
broke	1
in	1
morris	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
van	1
helsing	1
went	1
on	1
evidently	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
miss	1
lucy	1
is	1
dead	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
yes	1
then	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
wrong	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
if	1

arthur	1
jumped	1
to	1
his	1

cried	1

you	1

it	1
in	1

her	1
my	1
nights	1

was	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1

took	1
the	1
old	1
mans	1
hand	1
and	1

in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1

at	1

diary	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
quarter	1
before	1
twelve	1
oclock	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
churchyard	1
over	1
the	1
low	1
wall	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
dark	1
with	1
occasional	1
gleams	1
of	1
moonlight	1
between	1
the	1
rents	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
clouds	1
that	1
scudded	1
across	1
the	1
sky	1
we	1
all	1
kept	1
somehow	1
close	1
together	1
with	1
van	1
helsing	1
slightly	1
in	1
front	1
as	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
tomb	1
i	1
looked	1
well	1
at	1
arthur	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
proximity	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
laden	1
with	1
so	1
sorrowful	1
a	1
memory	1
would	1
upset	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
bore	1
himself	1
well	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
proceeding	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
a	1
counteractant	1
to	1
his	1
grief	1
the	1
professor	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
seeing	1
a	1
natural	1
hesitation	1
amongst	1
us	1
for	1
various	1
reasons	1
solved	1
the	1
difficulty	1
by	1
entering	1
first	1
himself	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us	1
followed	1
and	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
then	1
lit	1
a	1
dark	1
lantern	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
coffin	1
arthur	1
stepped	1
forward	1
hesitatingly	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
here	1
yesterday	1
was	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
miss	1
lucy	1
in	1
that	1
coffin	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
professor	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
saying	1
you	1
hear	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
screwdriver	1
and	1
again	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
the	1
coffin	1
arthur	1
looked	1
on	1
very	1
pale	1
but	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
lid	1
was	1
removed	1
he	1
stepped	1
forward	1
he	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
leaden	1
coffin	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
rent	1
in	1
the	1
lead	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
but	1
as	1
quickly	1
fell	1
away	1
again	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
remained	1
of	1
a	1
ghastly	1
whiteness	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
silent	1
van	1
helsing	1
forced	1
back	1
the	1
leaden	1
flange	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
looked	1
in	1
and	1
recoiled	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
empty	1
for	1
several	1
minutes	1
no	1
one	1
spoke	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
silence	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
quincey	1
morris	1
professor	1
i	1
answered	1
for	1
you	1
your	1
word	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
i	1
wouldnt	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
ordinarily	1
i	1
wouldnt	1
so	1
dishonour	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
imply	1
a	1
doubt	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
mystery	1
that	1
goes	1
beyond	1
any	1
honour	1
or	1
dishonour	1
is	1
this	1
your	1
doing	1
i	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
hold	1
sacred	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
removed	1
nor	1
touched	1
her	1
what	1
happened	1
was	1
this	1
two	1
nights	1
ago	1
my	1
friend	1
seward	1
and	1
i	1
came	1
here	1
with	1
good	1
purpose	1
believe	1
me	1
i	1
opened	1
that	1
coffin	1
which	1
was	1
then	1
sealed	1
up	1
and	1
we	1
found	1
it	1
as	1
now	1
empty	1
we	1
then	1
waited	1
and	1
saw	1
something	1
white	1
come	1
through	1
the	1
trees	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
here	1
in	1
daytime	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
there	1
did	1
she	1
not	1
friend	1
john	1
yes	1
that	1
night	1
we	1
were	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
one	1
more	1
so	1
small	1
child	1
was	1
missing	1
and	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
thank	1
god	1
unharmed	1
amongst	1
the	1
graves	1
yesterday	1
i	1
came	1
here	1
before	1
sundown	1
for	1
at	1
sundown	1
the	1
undead	1
can	1
move	1
i	1
waited	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
till	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
but	1
i	1
saw	1
nothing	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
probable	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
i	1
had	1
laid	1
over	1
the	1
clamps	1
of	1
those	1
doors	1
garlic	1
which	1
the	1
undead	1
cannot	1
bear	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
shun	1
last	1
night	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
exodus	1
so	1
tonight	1
before	1
the	1
sundown	1
i	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
garlic	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
find	1
this	1
coffin	1
empty	1
but	1
bear	1
with	1
me	1
so	1
far	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
that	1
is	1
strange	1
wait	1
you	1
with	1
me	1
outside	1
unseen	1
and	1
unheard	1
and	1
things	1
much	1
stranger	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
here	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
dark	1
slide	1
of	1
his	1
lantern	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
we	1
filed	1
out	1
he	1
coming	1
last	1
and	1
locking	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
oh	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
fresh	1
and	1
pure	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
air	1
after	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
that	1
vault	1
how	1
sweet	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
clouds	1
race	1
by	1
and	1
the	1
passing	1
gleams	1
of	1
the	1
moonlight	1
between	1
the	1
scudding	1
clouds	1
crossing	1
and	1
passing	1
like	1
the	1
gladness	1
and	1
sorrow	1
of	1
a	1
mans	1
life	1
how	1
sweet	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
breathe	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
taint	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
decay	1
how	1
humanising	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
red	1
lighting	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
beyond	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
far	1
away	1
the	1
muffled	1
roar	1
that	1
marks	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
city	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
was	1
solemn	1
and	1
overcome	1
arthur	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
was	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
striving	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
purpose	1
and	1
the	1
inner	1
meaning	1
of	1

morris	1
was	1
phlegmatic	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
accepts	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
accepts	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1

bravery	1
with	1
hazard	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
has	1
to	1

not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
smoke	1
he	1
cut	1
himself	1
a	1
goodsized	1
plug	1
of	1
tobacco	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
chew	1
as	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
he	1
was	1
employed	1
in	1
a	1
definite	1
way	1
first	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
bag	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
thin	1
waferlike	1
biscuit	1
which	1
was	1
carefully	1
rolled	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
napkin	1
next	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
doublehandful	1
of	1
some	1
whitish	1
stuff	1
like	1
dough	1
or	1
putty	1
he	1
crumbled	1
the	1
wafer	1
up	1
fine	1
and	1
worked	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
mass	1
between	1
his	1
hands	1
this	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
and	1
rolling	1
it	1
into	1
thin	1
strips	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
crevices	1
between	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
its	1
setting	1
in	1
the	1
tomb	1
i	1
was	1
somewhat	1
puzzled	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
being	1
close	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
drew	1
near	1
also	1
as	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
curious	1
he	1
answered	1
i	1
am	1
closing	1
the	1
tomb	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
undead	1
may	1
not	1
enter	1
and	1
is	1
that	1
stuff	1
you	1
have	1
put	1
there	1
going	1
to	1
do	1

scott	1
is	1
this	1
a	1
game	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
using	1
this	1

the	1
question	1
was	1
by	1
arthur	1
van	1
helsing	1
reverently	1
lifted	1
his	1
hat	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
the	1
host	1
i	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
amsterdam	1
i	1
have	1
an	1
indulgence	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
answer	1
that	1
appalled	1
the	1
most	1
sceptical	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
felt	1
individually	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
such	1
earnest	1
purpose	1
as	1
the	1
professors	1
a	1
purpose	1
which	1
could	1
thus	1
use	1
the	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
sacred	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
distrust	1
in	1
respectful	1
silence	1
we	1
took	1
the	1
places	1
assigned	1
to	1
us	1
close	1
round	1
the	1
tomb	1
but	1
hidden	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
approaching	1
i	1
pitied	1
the	1
others	1
especially	1
arthur	1
i	1
had	1
myself	1
been	1
apprenticed	1
by	1
my	1
former	1
visits	1
to	1
this	1
watching	1
horror	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
who	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
repudiated	1
the	1
proofs	1
felt	1
my	1
heart	1
sink	1
within	1
me	1
never	1
did	1
tombs	1
look	1
so	1
ghastly	1
white	1
never	1
did	1
cypress	1
or	1
yew	1
or	1
juniper	1
so	1
seem	1
the	1
embodiment	1
of	1
funeral	1
gloom	1
never	1
did	1
tree	1
or	1
grass	1
wave	1
or	1
rustle	1
so	1
ominously	1
never	1
did	1
bough	1
creak	1
so	1
mysteriously	1
and	1
never	1
did	1
the	1
faraway	1
howling	1
of	1
dogs	1
send	1
such	1
a	1
woeful	1
presage	1
through	1
the	1
night	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
spell	1
of	1
silence	1
a	1
big	1
aching	1
void	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
the	1
professor	1
a	1
keen	1
ssss	1
he	1
pointed	1
and	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
avenue	1
of	1
yews	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
figure	1
advance	1
a	1
dim	1
white	1
figure	1
which	1
held	1
something	1
dark	1
at	1
its	1
breast	1
the	1
figure	1
stopped	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
moonlight	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
masses	1
of	1
driving	1
clouds	1
and	1
showed	1
in	1
startling	1
prominence	1
a	1
darkhaired	1
woman	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
cerements	1
of	1
the	1
grave	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
face	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
what	1
we	1
saw	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fairhaired	1
child	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pause	1
and	1
a	1
sharp	1
little	1
cry	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
gives	1
in	1
sleep	1
or	1
a	1
dog	1
as	1
it	1
lies	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
dreams	1
we	1
were	1
starting	1
forward	1
but	1
the	1
professors	1
warning	1
hand	1
seen	1
by	1
us	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
behind	1
a	1
yewtree	1
kept	1
us	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
looked	1
the	1
white	1
figure	1
moved	1
forwards	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
see	1
clearly	1
and	1
the	1
moonlight	1
still	1
held	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
grew	1
cold	1
as	1
ice	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
gasp	1
of	1
arthur	1
as	1
we	1
recognised	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
lucy	1
westenra	1
lucy	1
westenra	1
but	1
yet	1
how	1
changed	1
the	1
sweetness	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
adamantine	1
heartless	1
cruelty	1
and	1
the	1
purity	1
to	1
voluptuous	1
wantonness	1
van	1
helsing	1
stepped	1
out	1
and	1
obedient	1
to	1
his	1
gesture	1
we	1
all	1
advanced	1
too	1
the	1
four	1
of	1
us	1
ranged	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
van	1
helsing	1
raised	1
his	1
lantern	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
slide	1
by	1
the	1
concentrated	1
light	1
that	1
fell	1
on	1
lucys	1
face	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
crimson	1
with	1
fresh	1
blood	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stream	1
had	1
trickled	1
over	1
her	1
chin	1
and	1
stained	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
her	1
lawn	1
deathrobe	1
we	1
shuddered	1
with	1
horror	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
the	1
tremulous	1
light	1
that	1
even	1
van	1
helsings	1
iron	1
nerve	1
had	1
failed	1
arthur	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seized	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
when	1
lucy	1
i	1
call	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
us	1
lucy	1
because	1
it	1
bore	1
her	1
shape	1
saw	1
us	1
she	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
snarl	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
cat	1
gives	1
when	1
taken	1
unawares	1
then	1
her	1
eyes	1
ranged	1
over	1
us	1
lucys	1
eyes	1
in	1
form	1
and	1
colour	1
but	1
lucys	1
eyes	1
unclean	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
hellfire	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
pure	1
gentle	1
orbs	1
we	1
knew	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
passed	1
into	1
hate	1
and	1
loathing	1
had	1
she	1
then	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
with	1
savage	1
delight	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
her	1
eyes	1
blazed	1
with	1
unholy	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
became	1
wreathed	1
with	1
a	1
voluptuous	1
smile	1
oh	1
god	1
how	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
careless	1
motion	1
she	1
flung	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
callous	1
as	1
a	1
devil	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
she	1
had	1
clutched	1
strenuously	1
to	1
her	1
breast	1
growling	1
over	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
dog	1
growls	1
over	1
a	1
bone	1
the	1
child	1
gave	1
a	1
sharp	1
cry	1
and	1
lay	1
there	1
moaning	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
coldbloodedness	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
which	1
wrung	1
a	1
groan	1
from	1
arthur	1
when	1
she	1
advanced	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
outstreched	1
arms	1
and	1
a	1
wanton	1
smile	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
still	1
advanced	1
however	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
languorous	1
voluptuous	1
grace	1
said	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
arthur	1
leave	1
these	1
others	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
arms	1
are	1
hungry	1
for	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
rest	1
together	1
come	1
my	1
husband	1
come	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
diabolically	1
sweet	1
in	1
her	1
tones	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
tingling	1
of	1
glass	1
when	1
struck	1
which	1
rang	1
through	1
the	1
brains	1
even	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
addressed	1
to	1
another	1
as	1
for	1
arthur	1
he	1
seemed	1
under	1
a	1
spell	1
moving	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
opened	1
wide	1
his	1
arms	1
she	1
was	1
leaping	1
for	1
them	1
when	1
van	1
helsing	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
held	1
between	1
them	1
his	1
little	1
golden	1
crucifix	1
she	1
recoiled	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
suddenly	1
distorted	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
rage	1
dashed	1
past	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
tomb	1
when	1
within	1
a	1
foot	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
however	1
she	1
stopped	1
as	1
if	1
arrested	1
by	1
some	1
irresistible	1
force	1
then	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
burst	1
of	1
moonlight	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
lamp	1
which	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
quiver	1
from	1
van	1
helsings	1
iron	1
nerves	1
never	1
did	1
i	1
see	1
such	1
baffled	1
malice	1
on	1
a	1
face	1
and	1
never	1
i	1
trust	1
shall	1
such	1
ever	1
be	1
seen	1
again	1
by	1
mortal	1
eyes	1
the	1
beautiful	1
colour	1
became	1
livid	1
the	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
sparks	1
of	1
hellfire	1
the	1
brows	1
were	1
wrinkled	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
were	1
the	1
coils	1
of	1
medusas	1
snakes	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
bloodstained	1
mouth	1
grew	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
square	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
passion	1
masks	1
of	1
the	1
greeks	1
and	1
japanese	1
if	1
ever	1
a	1
face	1
meant	1
death	1
if	1
looks	1
could	1
kill	1
we	1
saw	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
full	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
which	1
seemed	1
an	1
eternity	1
she	1
remained	1
between	1
the	1
lifted	1
crucifix	1
and	1
the	1
sacred	1
closing	1
of	1
her	1
means	1
of	1
entry	1
van	1
helsing	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
by	1
asking	1
arthur	1
answer	1
me	1
oh	1
my	1
friend	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
proceed	1
in	1
my	1
work	1
arthur	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
friend	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
horror	1
like	1
this	1
ever	1
any	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
groaned	1
in	1
spirit	1
quincey	1
and	1
i	1
simultaneously	1
moved	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arms	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
closing	1
lantern	1
as	1
van	1
helsing	1
held	1
it	1
down	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
tomb	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
remove	1
from	1
the	1
chinks	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
sacred	1
emblem	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
there	1
we	1
all	1
looked	1
on	1
in	1
horrified	1
amazement	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
back	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
corporeal	1
body	1
as	1
real	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
our	1
own	1
pass	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
interstice	1
where	1
scarce	1
a	1
knifeblade	1
could	1
have	1
gone	1
we	1
all	1
felt	1
a	1
glad	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
professor	1
calmly	1
restoring	1
the	1
strings	1
of	1
putty	1
to	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
he	1
lifted	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
said	1
come	1
now	1
my	1
friends	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
funeral	1
at	1
noon	1
so	1
here	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
come	1
before	1
long	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
gone	1
by	1
two	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sexton	1
lock	1
the	1
gate	1
we	1
shall	1
remain	1
then	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
not	1
like	1
this	1
of	1
tonight	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
little	1
one	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
harm	1
and	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
night	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
we	1
shall	1
leave	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
police	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
night	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
home	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
arthur	1
he	1
said	1
my	1
friend	1
arthur	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
sore	1
trial	1
but	1
after	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
look	1
back	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
bitter	1
waters	1
my	1
child	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
will	1
please	1
god	1
have	1
passed	1
them	1
and	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
sweet	1
waters	1
so	1
do	1
not	1
mourn	1
overmuch	1
till	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
came	1
home	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
cheer	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
we	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
child	1
in	1
safety	1
and	1
were	1
tired	1
so	1
we	1
all	1
slept	1
with	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
reality	1
of	1
sleep	1
29	1
september	1
night	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
twelve	1
oclock	1
we	1
three	1
arthur	1
quincey	1
morris	1
and	1
myself	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
it	1
was	1
odd	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
by	1
common	1
consent	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
put	1
on	1
black	1
clothes	1
of	1
course	1
arthur	1
wore	1
black	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
deep	1
mourning	1
but	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us	1
wore	1
it	1
by	1
instinct	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
churchyard	1
by	1
halfpast	1
one	1
and	1
strolled	1
about	1
keeping	1
out	1
of	1
official	1
observation	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
gravediggers	1
had	1
completed	1
their	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
sexton	1
under	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
gone	1
had	1
locked	1
the	1
gate	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
place	1
all	1
to	1
ourselves	1
van	1
helsing	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
black	1
bag	1
had	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
leather	1
one	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
cricketing	1
bag	1
it	1
was	1
manifestly	1
of	1
fair	1
weight	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
footsteps	1
die	1
out	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
we	1
silently	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
ordered	1
intention	1
followed	1
the	1
professor	1
to	1
the	1
tomb	1
he	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
closing	1
it	1
behind	1
us	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
bag	1
the	1
lantern	1
which	1
he	1
lit	1
and	1
also	1
two	1
wax	1
candles	1
which	1
when	1
lighted	1
he	1
stuck	1
by	1
melting	1
their	1
own	1
ends	1
on	1
other	1
coffins	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
light	1
sufficient	1
to	1
work	1
by	1
when	1
he	1
again	1
lifted	1
the	1
lid	1
off	1
lucys	1
coffin	1
we	1
all	1
looked	1
arthur	1
trembling	1
like	1
an	1
aspen	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
lay	1
there	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
deathbeauty	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
love	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
nothing	1
but	1
loathing	1
for	1
the	1
foul	1
thing	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
lucys	1
shape	1
without	1
her	1
soul	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
even	1
arthurs	1
face	1
grow	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
presently	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
is	1
this	1
really	1
lucys	1
body	1
or	1
only	1
a	1
demon	1
in	1
her	1
shape	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
body	1
and	1
yet	1
not	1
it	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
she	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
nightmare	1
of	1
lucy	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
there	1
the	1
pointed	1
teeth	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
voluptuous	1
mouth	1
which	1
it	1
made	1
one	1
shudder	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
carnal	1
and	1
unspiritual	1
appearance	1
seeming	1
like	1
a	1
devilish	1
mockery	1
of	1
lucys	1
sweet	1
purity	1
van	1
helsing	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
methodicalness	1
began	1
taking	1
the	1
various	1
contents	1
from	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
placing	1
them	1
ready	1
for	1
use	1
first	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
soldering	1
iron	1
and	1
some	1
plumbing	1
solder	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
small	1
oillamp	1
which	1
gave	1
out	1
when	1
lit	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
gas	1
which	1
burned	1
at	1
fierce	1
heat	1
with	1
a	1
blue	1
flame	1
then	1
his	1
operating	1
knives	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
last	1
a	1
round	1
wooden	1
stake	1
some	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
or	1
three	1
inches	1
thick	1
and	1
about	1
three	1
feet	1
long	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
hardened	1
by	1
charring	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
was	1
sharpened	1
to	1
a	1
fine	1
point	1
with	1
this	1
stake	1
came	1
a	1
heavy	1
hammer	1
such	1
as	1
in	1
households	1
is	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
coalcellar	1
for	1
breaking	1
the	1
lumps	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
doctors	1
preparations	1
for	1
work	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
are	1
stimulating	1
and	1
bracing	1
but	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
on	1
both	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
was	1
to	1
cause	1
them	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
consternation	1
they	1
both	1
however	1
kept	1
their	1
courage	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
quiet	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
ready	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
before	1
we	1
do	1
anything	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
lore	1
and	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
studied	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
undead	1
when	1
they	1
become	1
such	1
there	1
comes	1
with	1
the	1
change	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
immortality	1
they	1
cannot	1
die	1
but	1
must	1
go	1
on	1
age	1
after	1
age	1
adding	1
new	1
victims	1
and	1
multiplying	1
the	1
evils	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
die	1
from	1
the	1
preying	1
of	1
the	1
undead	1
become	1
themselves	1
undead	1
and	1
prey	1
on	1
their	1
kind	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
circle	1
goes	1
on	1
ever	1
widening	1
like	1
as	1
the	1
ripples	1
from	1
a	1
stone	1
thrown	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
friend	1
arthur	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
kiss	1
which	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
before	1
poor	1
lucy	1
die	1
or	1
again	1
last	1
night	1
when	1
you	1
open	1
your	1
arms	1
to	1
her	1
you	1
would	1
in	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
had	1
died	1
have	1
become	1
nosferatu	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it	1
in	1
eastern	1
europe	1
and	1
would	1
all	1
time	1
make	1
more	1
of	1
those	1
undeads	1
that	1
so	1
have	1
fill	1
us	1
with	1
horror	1
the	1
career	1
of	1
this	1
so	1
unhappy	1
dear	1
lady	1
is	1
but	1
just	1
begun	1
those	1
children	1
whose	1
blood	1
she	1
suck	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
live	1
on	1
undead	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
they	1
lose	1
their	1
blood	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
draw	1
their	1
blood	1
with	1
that	1
so	1
wicked	1
mouth	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
die	1
in	1
truth	1
then	1
all	1
cease	1
the	1
tiny	1
wounds	1
of	1
the	1
throats	1
disappear	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
plays	1
unknowing	1
ever	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
blessed	1
of	1
all	1
when	1
this	1
now	1
undead	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
rest	1
as	1
true	1
dead	1
then	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
lady	1
whom	1
we	1
love	1
shall	1
again	1
be	1
free	1
instead	1
of	1
working	1
wickedness	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
growing	1
more	1
debased	1
in	1
the	1
assimilation	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
day	1
she	1
shall	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
angels	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
friend	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
blessed	1
hand	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
shall	1
strike	1
the	1
blow	1
that	1
sets	1
her	1
free	1
to	1
this	1
i	1
am	1
willing	1
but	1
is	1
there	1
none	1
amongst	1
us	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
better	1
right	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
no	1
joy	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
hereafter	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
sleep	1
is	1
not	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
hand	1
that	1
sent	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
stars	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
her	1
best	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
have	1
chosen	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
choose	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
amongst	1
us	1
we	1
all	1
looked	1
at	1
arthur	1
he	1
saw	1
too	1
what	1
we	1
all	1
did	1
the	1
infinite	1
kindness	1
which	1
suggested	1
that	1
his	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
would	1
restore	1
lucy	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
a	1
holy	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
unholy	1
memory	1
he	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and	1
said	1
bravely	1
though	1
his	1
hand	1
trembled	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
snow	1
my	1
true	1
friend	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
my	1
broken	1
heart	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
falter	1
van	1
helsing	1
laid	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
said	1
brave	1
lad	1
a	1
moments	1
courage	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
this	1
stake	1
must	1
be	1
driven	1
through	1
her	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
fearful	1
ordeal	1
be	1
not	1
deceived	1
in	1
that	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
then	1
rejoice	1
more	1
than	1
your	1
pain	1
was	1
great	1
from	1
this	1
grim	1
tomb	1
you	1
will	1
emerge	1

though	1
you	1

you	1
must	1
not	1
falter	1
when	1
once	1
you	1
have	1
begun	1
only	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
your	1
true	1
friends	1
are	1
round	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
pray	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
go	1
on	1
said	1
arthur	1
hoarsely	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
take	1
this	1
stake	1
in	1
your	1
left	1
hand	1
ready	1
to	1
place	1
the	1
point	1
over	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
hammer	1
in	1
your	1
right	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
begin	1
our	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
i	1
shall	1
read	1
him	1
i	1
have	1
here	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
shall	1
follow	1
strike	1
in	1
gods	1

that	1
so	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
undead	1
pass	1
away	1
arthur	1
took	1
the	1
stake	1
and	1
the	1
hammer	1
and	1
when	1
once	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
action	1
his	1
hands	1
never	1
trembled	1
nor	1
even	1
quivered	1
van	1
helsing	1
opened	1
his	1
missal	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
quincey	1
and	1
i	1
followed	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
arthur	1
placed	1
the	1
point	1
over	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
its	1
dint	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
flesh	1
then	1
he	1
struck	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
writhed	1
and	1
a	1
hideous	1
bloodcurdling	1
screech	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
opened	1
red	1
lips	1
the	1
body	1
shook	1
and	1
quivered	1
and	1
twisted	1
in	1
wild	1
contortions	1
the	1
sharp	1
white	1
teeth	1
champed	1
together	1
till	1
the	1
lips	1
were	1
cut	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
was	1
smeared	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
foam	1
but	1
arthur	1
never	1
faltered	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
figure	1
of	1
thor	1
as	1
his	1
untrembling	1
arm	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
driving	1
deeper	1
and	1
deeper	1
the	1
mercybearing	1
stake	1
whilst	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
the	1
pierced	1
heart	1
welled	1
and	1
spurted	1
up	1
around	1
it	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
set	1
and	1
high	1
duty	1
seemed	1
to	1
shine	1
through	1
it	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
gave	1
us	1
courage	1
so	1
that	1
our	1
voices	1
seemed	1
to	1
ring	1
through	1
the	1
little	1
vault	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
writhing	1
and	1
quivering	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
became	1
less	1
and	1
the	1
teeth	1
seemed	1
to	1
champ	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
to	1
quiver	1
finally	1
it	1
lay	1
still	1
the	1
terrible	1
task	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
hammer	1
fell	1
from	1
arthurs	1
hand	1
he	1
reeled	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
had	1
we	1
not	1
caught	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
drops	1
of	1
sweat	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
his	1
breath	1
came	1
in	1
broken	1
gasps	1
it	1
had	1
indeed	1
been	1
an	1
awful	1
strain	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
his	1
task	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
human	1
considerations	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
with	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
towards	1
the	1
coffin	1
when	1
we	1
did	1
however	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
startled	1
surprise	1
ran	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us	1
we	1
gazed	1
so	1
eagerly	1
that	1
arthur	1
rose	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
looked	1
too	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
glad	1
strange	1
light	1
broke	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
dispelled	1
altogether	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
horror	1
that	1
lay	1
upon	1
it	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
lay	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
foul	1
thing	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
so	1
dreaded	1
and	1
grown	1
to	1
hate	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
her	1
destruction	1
was	1
yielded	1
as	1
a	1
privilege	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
best	1
entitled	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
lucy	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
of	1
unequalled	1
sweetness	1
and	1
purity	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
there	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
in	1
life	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
care	1
and	1
pain	1
and	1
waste	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
dear	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
they	1
marked	1
her	1
truth	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
knew	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
we	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
holy	1
calm	1
that	1
lay	1
like	1
sunshine	1
over	1
the	1
wasted	1
face	1
and	1
form	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
earthly	1
token	1
and	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
calm	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
reign	1
forever	1
van	1
helsing	1
came	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
arthurs	1

now	1
arthur	1
my	1

not	1
forgiven	1
the	1
reaction	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
strain	1
came	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
old	1
mans	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
raising	1
it	1

laying	1
his	1

on	1
his	1

cried	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
silently	1
whilst	1
we	1
stood	1
unmoving	1
when	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
van	1

with	1
him	1
arthur	1
bent	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
sent	1
him	1
and	1
quincey	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
i	1
sawed	1
the	1
top	1
off	1
the	1
stake	1
leaving	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
then	1
we	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
mouth	1
with	1
garlic	1
we	1
soldered	1
up	1
the	1
leaden	1
coffin	1
screwed	1
on	1
the	1
coffinlid	1
and	1
gathering	1
up	1
our	1

came	1
away	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
arthur	1
outside	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
sweet	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
sang	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
nature	1
were	1
tuned	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
pitch	1
there	1
was	1
gladness	1
and	1
mirth	1
and	1
peace	1
everywhere	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
rest	1
ourselves	1
on	1
one	1
account	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
glad	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
tempered	1
joy	1
before	1
we	1
moved	1
away	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
now	1
my	1
friends	1
one	1
step	1
of	1
our	1
work	1
is	1
done	1
one	1
the	1
most	1
harrowing	1
to	1
ourselves	1
but	1
there	1
remains	1
a	1
greater	1
task	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
our	1
sorrow	1
and	1
to	1
stamp	1
him	1
out	1
i	1
have	1
clues	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
follow	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
task	1
and	1
a	1
difficult	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
danger	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
pain	1
shall	1
you	1
not	1
all	1
help	1
me	1
we	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
believe	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
and	1
since	1
so	1
do	1
we	1
not	1
see	1
our	1
duty	1
yes	1

do	1
we	1
not	1

on	1
to	1
the	1
better	1
end	1
each	1
in	1
turn	1
we	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
made	1
then	1

took	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
paddington	1
where	1
i	1
arrived	1
about	1
fifteen	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
train	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
melted	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
bustling	1
fashion	1
common	1
to	1
arrival	1
platforms	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
uneasy	1
last	1
i	1
might	1
miss	1
my	1
guest	1
when	1
a	1
sweetfaced	1
daintylooking	1
girl	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
quick	1
glance	1
said	1
dr	1
seward	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
mrs	1
harker	1
i	1
answered	1
at	1
once	1
whereupon	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
i	1
knew	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucy	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
blush	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
blush	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
cheeks	1
somehow	1
set	1
us	1
both	1
at	1
ease	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
tacit	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
i	1
got	1
her	1
luggage	1
which	1
included	1
a	1
typewriter	1
and	1
we	1
took	1
the	1
underground	1
to	1
fenchurch	1
street	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1

to	1
my	1
housekeeper	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
sittingroom	1
and	1
bedroom	1
prepared	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
mrs	1
harker	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
we	1
arrived	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
repress	1
a	1
shudder	1
when	1
we	1
entered	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
presently	1
to	1
my	1
study	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
finishing	1
my	1
entry	1
in	1
my	1
phonograph	1

i	1
await	1
her	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
van	1
helsing	1
left	1
with	1
me	1
though	1
they	1
lie	1
open	1
before	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
get	1
her	1
interested	1
in	1
something	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
reading	1
them	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
precious	1
time	1
is	1
or	1
what	1
a	1
task	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
hand	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
frighten	1
her	1

29	1
september	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
tidied	1
myself	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
dr	1
sewards	1
study	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
paused	1
a	1
moment	1
for	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
talking	1
with	1
some	1
one	1
as	1
however	1
he	1
had	1
pressed	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
quick	1
i	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
calling	1
out	1
come	1
in	1
i	1
entered	1
to	1
my	1
intense	1
surprise	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
alone	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
opposite	1
him	1
was	1
what	1
i	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
the	1
description	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
phonograph	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
one	1
and	1
was	1
much	1
interested	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
waiting	1
i	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
stayed	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
i	1
heard	1
you	1
talking	1
and	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
one	1
with	1
you	1
oh	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
i	1
was	1
only	1
entering	1
my	1
diary	1
your	1
diary	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
in	1
surprise	1
yes	1
he	1
answered	1
i	1
keep	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
phonograph	1
i	1
felt	1
quite	1
excited	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
blurted	1
out	1
why	1
this	1
beats	1
even	1
shorthand	1
may	1
i	1
hear	1
it	1
say	1
something	1
certainly	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
alacrity	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
train	1
for	1
speaking	1
then	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
a	1
troubled	1
look	1
overspread	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
he	1
began	1
awkwardly	1
i	1
only	1
keep	1
my	1
diary	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
entirely	1
almost	1
entirely	1
about	1
my	1
cases	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
awkward	1
that	1
is	1
i	1
mean	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
embarrassment	1
you	1
helped	1
to	1
attend	1
dear	1
lucy	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
how	1
she	1
died	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
her	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
grateful	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
horrorstruck	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
wide	1
world	1
why	1
not	1
i	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
grave	1
terrible	1
feeling	1
was	1
coming	1
over	1
me	1
again	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
invent	1
an	1
excuse	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
stammered	1
out	1
you	1
see	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
pick	1
out	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
diary	1
even	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
an	1
idea	1
dawned	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
unconscious	1
simplicity	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
naivete	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
thats	1
quite	1
true	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
honest	1
indian	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
smile	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
grimaced	1
i	1
gave	1
myself	1
away	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
although	1
i	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
diary	1
for	1
months	1
past	1
it	1
never	1
once	1
struck	1
me	1
how	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
find	1
any	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
case	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
that	1
the	1
diary	1
of	1
a	1
doctor	1
who	1
attended	1
lucy	1
might	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
terrible	1
being	1
and	1
i	1
said	1
boldly	1
then	1
dr	1
seward	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
let	1
me	1
copy	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
on	1
my	1
typewriter	1
he	1
grew	1
to	1
a	1
positively	1
deathly	1
pallor	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
no	1
no	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
wouldnt	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
terrible	1
story	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
terrible	1
my	1
intuition	1
was	1
right	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
thought	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
eyes	1
ranged	1
the	1
room	1
unconsciously	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
or	1
some	1
opportunity	1
to	1
aid	1
me	1
they	1
lit	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
batch	1
of	1
typewriting	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
his	1
eyes	1
caught	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
mine	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
thinking	1
followed	1
their	1
direction	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
parcel	1
he	1
realised	1
my	1
meaning	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
read	1
those	1
papers	1
my	1
own	1
diary	1
and	1
my	1
husbands	1
also	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
typed	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
me	1
better	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
faltered	1
in	1
giving	1
every	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
in	1
this	1
cause	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
me	1
yet	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
trust	1
me	1
so	1
far	1
he	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
noble	1
nature	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucy	1
was	1
right	1
about	1
him	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
large	1
drawer	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
arranged	1
in	1
order	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
hollow	1
cylinders	1
of	1
metal	1
covered	1
with	1
dark	1
wax	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
right	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
trust	1
you	1
because	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
now	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
long	1
ago	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
lucy	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
me	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
you	1
too	1
may	1
i	1
make	1
the	1
only	1
atonement	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
take	1
the	1
cylinders	1
and	1
hear	1
them	1
the	1
first	1
halfdozen	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
personal	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
horrify	1
you	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
me	1
better	1
dinner	1
will	1
by	1
then	1
be	1
ready	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
i	1
shall	1
read	1
over	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
documents	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
certain	1
things	1
he	1
carried	1
the	1
phonograph	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
sittingroom	1
and	1
adjusted	1
it	1
for	1
me	1
now	1
i	1
shall	1
learn	1
something	1
pleasant	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
love	1
episode	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
know	1
one	1
side	1
already	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
29	1
september	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
that	1
wonderful	1
diary	1
of	1
jonathan	1
harker	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
i	1
let	1
the	1
time	1
run	1
on	1
without	1
thinking	1
mrs	1
harker	1
was	1
not	1
down	1
when	1
the	1
maid	1
came	1
to	1
announce	1
dinner	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
she	1
is	1
possibly	1
tired	1
let	1
dinner	1
wait	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
work	1
i	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
diary	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
looked	1
sweetly	1
pretty	1
but	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
flushed	1
with	1
crying	1
this	1
somehow	1
moved	1
me	1
much	1
of	1
late	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
cause	1
for	1
tears	1
god	1
knows	1
but	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
denied	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
sweet	1
eyes	1
brightened	1
with	1
recent	1
tears	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
as	1
gently	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
i	1

me	1
she	1
replied	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
touched	1
than	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
by	1
your	1
grief	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
machine	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
cruelly	1
true	1
it	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
its	1
very	1
tones	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
soul	1
crying	1
out	1
to	1
almighty	1
god	1
no	1
one	1
must	1
hear	1
them	1
spoken	1
ever	1
again	1
see	1
i	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
i	1
have	1
copied	1
out	1
the	1
words	1
on	1
my	1
typewriter	1
and	1
none	1
other	1
need	1
now	1
hear	1
your	1
heart	1
beat	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
no	1
one	1
need	1
ever	1
know	1
shall	1
ever	1
know	1
i	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
she	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
mine	1
and	1
said	1
very	1
gravely	1
ah	1
but	1
they	1
must	1
must	1
but	1
why	1
i	1
asked	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
story	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucys	1
death	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
us	1
to	1
rid	1
the	1
earth	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
monster	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
knowledge	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
help	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
cylinders	1
which	1
you	1
gave	1
me	1
contained	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
intended	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
record	1
many	1
lights	1
to	1
this	1
dark	1
mystery	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
help	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
i	1
know	1
all	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
and	1
i	1
see	1
already	1
though	1
your	1
diary	1
only	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
7	1
september	1
how	1
poor	1
lucy	1
was	1
beset	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
terrible	1
doom	1
was	1
being	1
wrought	1
out	1
jonathan	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
working	1
day	1

night	1
since	1

will	1

us	1
we	1
need	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
amongst	1
us	1
working	1
together	1
and	1
with	1
absolute	1
trust	1
we	1
can	1
surely	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
so	1
appealingly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
manifested	1
such	1
courage	1
and	1
resolution	1
in	1
her	1
bearing	1
that	1
i	1
gave	1
in	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
her	1
wishes	1
you	1
shall	1

there	1
are	1
terrible	1
things	1
yet	1
to	1

of	1

if	1
you	1
so	1
have	1
so	1
far	1
travelled	1
on	1
the	1
road	1

29	1
september	1
after	1
dinner	1
i	1
came	1
with	1
dr	1
seward	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
the	1
phonograph	1
from	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
my	1
typewriter	1
he	1
placed	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
comfortable	1
chair	1
and	1
arranged	1
the	1
phonograph	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
touch	1
it	1
without	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
showed	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
stop	1
it	1
in	1
case	1
i	1
should	1
want	1
to	1
pause	1
then	1
he	1
very	1
thoughtfully	1
took	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
i	1
put	1
the	1
forked	1
metal	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
listened	1
when	1
the	1
terrible	1
story	1
of	1
lucys	1
death	1
and	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
done	1
i	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
my	1
chair	1
powerless	1
fortunately	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
fainting	1
disposition	1
when	1
dr	1
seward	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
horrified	1
exclamation	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
taking	1
a	1
casebottle	1
from	1
a	1
cupboard	1
gave	1
me	1
some	1
brandy	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
somewhat	1
restored	1
me	1
my	1
brain	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
whirl	1
and	1
only	1
that	1
there	1
came	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
horrors	1
the	1
holy	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
dear	1
lucy	1
was	1
at	1
lest	1
at	1
peace	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
it	1
without	1
making	1
a	1
scene	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
so	1
wild	1
and	1
mysterious	1
and	1
strange	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
jonathans	1
experience	1
in	1
transylvania	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
didnt	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
so	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
difficulty	1
by	1
attending	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
cover	1
off	1
my	1
typewriter	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
dr	1
seward	1
let	1
me	1
write	1
this	1
all	1
out	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
i	1
have	1
sent	1
a	1
telegram	1
to	1
jonathan	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
here	1
when	1
he	1
arrives	1
in	1
london	1
from	1
whitby	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
dates	1
are	1
everything	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
get	1
all	1
our	1
material	1
ready	1
and	1
have	1
every	1
item	1
put	1
in	1
chronological	1
order	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
much	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
are	1
coming	1
too	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
he	1
accordingly	1
set	1
the	1
phonograph	1
at	1
a	1
slow	1
pace	1
and	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
typewrite	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
cylinder	1
i	1
used	1
manifold	1
and	1
so	1
took	1
three	1
copies	1
of	1
the	1
diary	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
through	1
but	1
dr	1
seward	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
work	1
of	1
going	1
his	1
round	1
of	1
the	1
patients	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
sat	1
near	1
me	1
reading	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
too	1
lonely	1
whilst	1
i	1
worked	1
how	1
good	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
world	1
seems	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
men	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
monsters	1
in	1
it	1
before	1
i	1
left	1
him	1
i	1
remembered	1
what	1
jonathan	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
diary	1
of	1
the	1
professors	1
perturbation	1
at	1
reading	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
evening	1
paper	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
at	1
exeter	1
so	1
seeing	1
that	1
dr	1
seward	1
keeps	1
his	1
newspapers	1
i	1
borrowed	1
the	1
files	1
of	1
the	1
westminister	1
gazette	1
and	1
the	1
pall	1
mall	1
gazette	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
i	1
remember	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
dailygraph	1
and	1
the	1
whitby	1
gazette	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
made	1
cuttings	1
helped	1
us	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
terrible	1
events	1
at	1
whitby	1
when	1
count	1
dracula	1
landed	1
so	1
i	1
shall	1
look	1
through	1
the	1
evening	1
papers	1
since	1
then	1
and	1
perhaps	1
i	1
shall	1
get	1
some	1
new	1
light	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
sleepy	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
will	1
help	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
quiet	1

mr	1
harker	1
arrived	1
at	1
nine	1
oclock	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
his	1
wifes	1
wire	1
just	1
before	1
starting	1
he	1
is	1
uncommonly	1
clever	1
if	1
one	1
can	1
judge	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
energy	1
if	1
his	1
journal	1
be	1
true	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
ones	1
own	1
wonderful	1
experiences	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
he	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
nerve	1
that	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
vault	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
was	1
a	1
remarkable	1
piece	1
of	1
daring	1
after	1
reading	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
good	1
specimen	1
of	1
manhood	1
but	1
hardly	1
the	1
quiet	1
businesslike	1
gentleman	1
who	1
came	1
here	1
today	1
later	1
after	1
lunch	1
harker	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
passed	1
a	1
while	1
ago	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
the	1
typewriter	1
they	1
are	1
hard	1
at	1
it	1
mrs	1
harker	1
says	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
knitting	1
together	1
in	1
chronological	1
order	1
every	1
scrap	1
of	1
evidence	1
they	1
have	1
harker	1
has	1
got	1
the	1
letters	1
between	1
the	1
consignee	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
at	1
whitby	1
and	1
the	1
carriers	1
in	1
london	1
who	1
took	1
charge	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
reading	1
his	1
wifes	1
typescript	1
of	1
my	1
diary	1
i	1
wonder	1
what	1
they	1
make	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
strange	1
that	1
it	1
never	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
house	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
counts	1
hidingplace	1
goodness	1
knows	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
enough	1
clues	1
from	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
renfield	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
letters	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
typescript	1
oh	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
only	1
had	1
them	1
earlier	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
saved	1
poor	1
lucy	1
stop	1
that	1
way	1
madness	1
lies	1
harker	1
has	1
gone	1
back	1
and	1
is	1
again	1
collating	1
his	1
material	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
by	1
dinnertime	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
a	1
whole	1
connected	1
narrative	1
he	1
thinks	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
i	1
should	1
see	1
renfield	1
as	1
hitherto	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
index	1
to	1
the	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
i	1
hardly	1
see	1
this	1
yet	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
get	1

suppose	1
i	1
shall	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
mrs	1
harker	1
put	1
my	1

into	1
type	1
we	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
found	1
the	1

otherwise	1
i	1
found	1
renfield	1
sitting	1
placidly	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
folded	1
smiling	1
benignly	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
sane	1
as	1
any	1
one	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
subjects	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
naturally	1
he	1
then	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
spoke	1
of	1
going	1
home	1
a	1
subject	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
mentioned	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
during	1
his	1
sojourn	1
here	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
spoke	1
quite	1
confidently	1
of	1
getting	1
his	1
discharge	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
had	1
i	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
chat	1
with	1
harker	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
the	1
dates	1
of	1
his	1
outbursts	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
prepared	1
to	1
sign	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
time	1
of	1
observation	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
am	1
darkly	1
suspicious	1
all	1
those	1
outbreaks	1
were	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
linked	1
with	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
what	1
then	1
does	1
his	1
absolute	1
content	1
mean	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
his	1
instinct	1
is	1
satisfied	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
vampires	1
ultimate	1

he	1
is	1

in	1
his	1
wild	1
ravings	1
outside	1
the	1
chapel	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
deserted	1
house	1
he	1
always	1
spoke	1
of	1

this	1
all	1
seems	1
confirmation	1
of	1
our	1
idea	1

after	1

i	1
came	1

my	1

just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
sane	1
at	1

to	1
make	1
it	1
safe	1
to	1
probe	1
him	1
too	1
deep	1
with	1
questions	1
he	1
might	1
begin	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
then	1
so	1
i	1
came	1
away	1
i	1
mistrust	1
these	1
quiet	1
moods	1
of	1
his	1
so	1
i	1
have	1
given	1
the	1

a	1
hint	1
to	1
look	1
closely	1

met	1
me	1
at	1

brought	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
fathers	1

where	1
they	1

that	1
my	1

was	1
short	1
and	1
mr	1

had	1
ready	1
in	1

office	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
concerning	1
the	1
consignment	1
of	1
boxes	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
almost	1
a	1
turn	1
to	1
see	1
again	1
one	1
of	1
the	1

which	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1

i	1
knew	1
of	1

plans	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
carefully	1
thought	1
out	1
and	1
done	1
systematically	1

with	1
precision	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1

prepared	1
for	1
every	1

out	1
to	1

an	1

he	1
had	1

and	1
the	1
absolute	1
accuracy	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
instructions	1
were	1
fulfilled	1
was	1
simply	1
the	1
logical	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
care	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
invoice	1
and	1
took	1
note	1
of	1
it	1
fifty	1
cases	1
of	1
common	1
earth	1
to	1
be	1

for	1
experimental	1
purposes	1
also	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
letter	1
to	1
carter	1
paterson	1
and	1
their	1
reply	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
i	1
got	1
copies	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
information	1
mr	1
billington	1
could	1
give	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
port	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
coastguards	1
the	1
customs	1
officers	1
and	1
the	1
harbourmaster	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
which	1
is	1
already	1
taking	1
its	1
place	1
in	1
local	1
tradition	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
simple	1
description	1
fifty	1
cases	1
of	1
common	1
earth	1
i	1
then	1
saw	1
the	1
stationmaster	1
who	1
kindly	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
actually	1
received	1
the	1
boxes	1
their	1
tally	1
was	1
exact	1
with	1
the	1
list	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
add	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
boxes	1
were	1
main	1
and	1
mortal	1
heavy	1
and	1
that	1
shifting	1
them	1
was	1
dry	1
work	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
added	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
lines	1
that	1
there	1
wasnt	1
any	1
gentleman	1
suchlike	1
as	1
yourself	1

to	1
show	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
appreciation	1
of	1
their	1
efforts	1
in	1
a	1
liquid	1
form	1
another	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
rider	1
that	1
the	1
thirst	1
then	1
generated	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
had	1
elapsed	1
had	1
not	1
completely	1
allayed	1
it	1
needless	1
to	1
add	1
i	1
took	1
care	1
before	1
leaving	1
to	1
lift	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
adequately	1
this	1
source	1
of	1
reproach	1
30	1
september	1
the	1
stationmaster	1
was	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
companion	1
the	1
stationmaster	1
at	1
kings	1
cross	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
he	1
too	1
put	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
proper	1
officials	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
tally	1
was	1
correct	1
with	1
the	1
original	1
invoice	1
the	1
opportunities	1
of	1
acquiring	1
an	1
abnormal	1
thirst	1
had	1
been	1
here	1
limited	1
a	1
noble	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
however	1
been	1
made	1
and	1
again	1
i	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
in	1
an	1
ex	1
post	1
facto	1
manner	1
from	1
thence	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
carter	1
pattersons	1
central	1
office	1
where	1
i	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
courtesy	1
they	1
looked	1
up	1
the	1
transaction	1
in	1
their	1
daybook	1
and	1
letterbook	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
telephoned	1
to	1
their	1
kings	1

for	1
more	1
details	1
by	1
good	1

the	1
men	1
who	1
did	1
the	1
teaming	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
official	1
at	1
once	1
sent	1
them	1
over	1
sending	1
also	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
waybill	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
at	1
carfax	1
here	1
again	1
i	1
found	1
the	1

agreeing	1
exactly	1
the	1
carriers	1

were	1
able	1
to	1
supplement	1
the	1
paucity	1
of	1
the	1
written	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
details	1
these	1
were	1
i	1
shortly	1
found	1
connected	1
almost	1
solely	1
with	1
the	1
dusty	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
job	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
consequent	1

engendered	1
in	1

if	1

i	1
am	1
now	1
satisfied	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
boxes	1
which	1
arrived	1
at	1
whitby	1
from	1

safely	1

hardly	1

how	1
to	1

it	1

the	1

from	1

in	1
order	1
for	1
tonight	1
i	1
feel	1
myself	1
quite	1
wild	1
with	1
excitement	1
i	1
suppose	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
pity	1
any	1
thing	1
so	1
hunted	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
it	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
human	1
not	1
even	1
beast	1
to	1
read	1
dr	1
sewards	1
account	1
of	1
poor	1
lucys	1
death	1
and	1
what	1
followed	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
dry	1
up	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
pity	1
in	1
ones	1
heart	1
later	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
arrived	1
earlier	1
than	1
we	1
expected	1
dr	1
seward	1
was	1
out	1
on	1
business	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
jonathan	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
painful	1
meeting	1
for	1
it	1
brought	1
back	1
all	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucys	1
hopes	1
of	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
ago	1
of	1
course	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
lucy	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
too	1
has	1
been	1
quite	1
blowing	1
my	1
trumpet	1
as	1
mr	1
morris	1
expressed	1
it	1
poor	1
fellows	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
aware	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
proposals	1
they	1
made	1
to	1
lucy	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
my	1
knowledge	1
so	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
on	1
neutral	1
subjects	1
however	1
i	1
thought	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
post	1
them	1
in	1
affairs	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
date	1
i	1
knew	1
from	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
lucys	1
death	1
her	1
real	1
death	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
betray	1
any	1
secret	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
so	1
i	1
told	1
them	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
diaries	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
i	1
having	1
typewritten	1
them	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
putting	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
i	1
gave	1
them	1
each	1
a	1
copy	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
when	1
lord	1
godalming	1
got	1
his	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
over	1
it	1
does	1
make	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
pile	1
he	1
said	1
did	1
you	1
write	1
all	1
this	1
mrs	1
harker	1
i	1
nodded	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
dont	1
quite	1
see	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
people	1
are	1
all	1
so	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
working	1
so	1
earnestly	1
and	1
so	1
energetically	1
that	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
accept	1
your	1
ideas	1
blindfold	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
one	1
lesson	1
already	1
in	1
accepting	1
facts	1
that	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
humble	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
besides	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
loved	1
my	1
poor	1
lucy	1
here	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
mr	1
morris	1
with	1
instinctive	1
delicacy	1
just	1
laid	1
a	1
hand	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
quietly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
suppose	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
womans	1
nature	1
that	1
makes	1
a	1
man	1
free	1
to	1
break	1
down	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
feelings	1
on	1
the	1
tender	1
or	1
emotional	1
side	1
without	1
feeling	1
it	1
derogatory	1
to	1
his	1
manhood	1
for	1
when	1
lord	1
godalming	1
found	1
himself	1
alone	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
gave	1
way	1
utterly	1
and	1
openly	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
i	1
hope	1
he	1
didnt	1
think	1
it	1
forward	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
ever	1
thinks	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards	1
he	1
never	1
will	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
thought	1
there	1
i	1
wrong	1
him	1
i	1
know	1
he	1
never	1
will	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
true	1
a	1
gentleman	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
breaking	1
i	1
loved	1
dear	1
lucy	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
like	1
sisters	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
gone	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
trouble	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
sorrows	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
though	1
i	1
cannot	1
measure	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
them	1
if	1
sympathy	1
and	1
pity	1
can	1
help	1
in	1
your	1
affliction	1
wont	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
service	1
for	1
lucys	1
sake	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
poor	1
dear	1
fellow	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
grief	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
suffering	1
in	1
silence	1
found	1
a	1
vent	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
grew	1
quite	1
hysterical	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
open	1
hands	1
beat	1
his	1
palms	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
agony	1
of	1
grief	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
rained	1
down	1
his	1
cheeks	1
i	1
felt	1
an	1
infinite	1
pity	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
opened	1
my	1
arms	1
unthinkingly	1
with	1
a	1
sob	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
cried	1
like	1
a	1
wearied	1
child	1
whilst	1
he	1
shook	1
with	1
emotion	1
we	1
women	1
have	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
us	1
that	1
makes	1
us	1
rise	1
above	1
smaller	1
matters	1
when	1
the	1
motherspirit	1
is	1
invoked	1
i	1
felt	1
this	1
big	1
sorrowing	1
mans	1
head	1
resting	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
that	1
some	1
day	1
may	1
he	1
on	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
i	1
stroked	1
his	1
hair	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
my	1
own	1
child	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
his	1
sobs	1
ceased	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
apology	1
though	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
disguise	1
of	1
his	1
emotion	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
past	1
weary	1
days	1
and	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
sorrow	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
woman	1
whose	1
sympathy	1
could	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
with	1
whom	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
terrible	1
circumstance	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
sorrow	1
was	1
surrounded	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
freely	1
i	1
know	1
now	1
how	1
i	1
suffered	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
dried	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
even	1
yet	1
and	1
none	1
other	1
can	1
ever	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
your	1
sweet	1
sympathy	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
today	1
i	1
shall	1
know	1
better	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
that	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
ungrateful	1
now	1
my	1
gratitude	1
will	1
grow	1
with	1
my	1
understanding	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
brother	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
dear	1
lucys	1
sake	1
for	1
dear	1
lucys	1
sake	1
i	1
said	1
as	1
we	1
clasped	1
hands	1
ay	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake	1
he	1
added	1
for	1
if	1
a	1
mans	1
esteem	1
and	1
gratitude	1
are	1
ever	1
worth	1
the	1
winning	1
you	1
have	1
won	1
mine	1
today	1
if	1
ever	1
the	1
future	1
should	1
bring	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
need	1
a	1
mans	1
help	1
believe	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
in	1
vain	1
god	1
grant	1
that	1
no	1
such	1
time	1
may	1
ever	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
sunshine	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
ever	1
come	1
promise	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
earnest	1
and	1
his	1
sorrow	1
was	1
so	1
fresh	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
would	1
comfort	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
promise	1
as	1
i	1
came	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
i	1
saw	1
mr	1
morris	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
window	1
he	1
turned	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
my	1
footsteps	1
how	1
is	1
art	1
he	1
said	1
then	1
noticing	1
my	1
red	1
eyes	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
ah	1
i	1
see	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
comforting	1
him	1
poor	1
old	1
fellow	1
he	1
needs	1
it	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
help	1
a	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
trouble	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
he	1
bore	1
his	1
own	1
trouble	1
so	1
bravely	1
that	1
my	1
heart	1
bled	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
manuscript	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
realise	1
how	1
much	1
i	1
knew	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
comfort	1
all	1
who	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
will	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
your	1
friend	1
and	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
comfort	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
later	1
on	1
why	1
i	1
speak	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
earnest	1
and	1
stooping	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
raising	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
kissed	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
but	1
poor	1
comfort	1
to	1
so	1
brave	1
and	1
unselfish	1
a	1
soul	1
and	1
impulsively	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
the	1
tears	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
choking	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
he	1
said	1
quite	1
calmly	1
little	1
girl	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
regret	1
that	1
truehearted	1
kindness	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
ever	1
you	1
live	1
then	1

went	1
into	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
his	1

and	1
letters	1

and	1
his	1
wonderful	1
wife	1
had	1
made	1
and	1

returned	1
from	1

visit	1
to	1
the	1
carriers	1
men	1
of	1
whom	1
dr	1
hennessey	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
me	1
mrs	1
harker	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
honestly	1
say	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
i	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
it	1
this	1
old	1
house	1
seemed	1
like	1
home	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
mrs	1
harker	1
said	1
dr	1
seward	1
may	1
i	1
ask	1
a	1
favour	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
patient	1
mr	1
renfield	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
him	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
your	1
diary	1
interests	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
she	1
looked	1
so	1
appealing	1
and	1
so	1
pretty	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
her	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possible	1
reason	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
so	1
i	1
took	1
her	1
with	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
a	1
lady	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
simply	1
answered	1
why	1
she	1
is	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
answered	1
oh	1
very	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
let	1
her	1
come	1
in	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
but	1
just	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
till	1
i	1
tidy	1
up	1
the	1
place	1
his	1
method	1
of	1
tidying	1
was	1
peculiar	1
he	1
simply	1
swallowed	1
all	1
the	1
flies	1
and	1
spiders	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
stop	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
feared	1
or	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
some	1
interference	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
through	1
his	1
disgusting	1
task	1
he	1
said	1
cheerfully	1
let	1
the	1
lady	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
down	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
eyelids	1
raised	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
homicidal	1
intent	1
i	1
remembered	1
how	1
quiet	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
before	1
he	1
attacked	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
study	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
stand	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
seize	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
if	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
spring	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
easy	1
gracefulness	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
command	1
the	1
respect	1
of	1
any	1
lunatic	1
for	1
easiness	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
qualities	1
mad	1
people	1
most	1
respect	1
she	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
smiling	1
pleasantly	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
goodevening	1
mr	1
renfield	1
said	1
she	1
you	1
see	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
for	1
dr	1
seward	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
you	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
immediate	1
reply	1
but	1
eyed	1
her	1
all	1
over	1
intently	1
with	1
a	1
set	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
this	1
look	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
wonder	1
which	1
merged	1
in	1
doubt	1
then	1
to	1
my	1
intense	1
astonishment	1
he	1
said	1
youre	1
not	1
the	1
girl	1
the	1
doctor	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
are	1
you	1
you	1
cant	1
be	1
you	1
know	1
for	1
shes	1
dead	1
mrs	1
harker	1
smiled	1
sweetly	1
as	1
she	1
replied	1
oh	1
no	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
husband	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
married	1
before	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
dr	1
seward	1
or	1
he	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
mrs	1
harker	1
then	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
here	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
i	1
are	1
staying	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
with	1
dr	1
seward	1
then	1
dont	1
stay	1
but	1
why	1
not	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
style	1
of	1
conversation	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
mrs	1
harker	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
joined	1
in	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
any	1
one	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
simply	1
contemptuous	1
given	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
mrs	1
harker	1
to	1
me	1
instantly	1
turning	1
them	1
back	1
again	1
what	1
an	1
asinine	1
question	1
i	1
dont	1
see	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
mr	1
renfield	1
said	1
mrs	1
harker	1
at	1
once	1
championing	1
me	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
courtesy	1
and	1
respect	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
contempt	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
understand	1
mrs	1
harker	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
so	1
loved	1
and	1
honoured	1
as	1
our	1
host	1
is	1
everything	1
regarding	1
him	1
is	1
of	1
interest	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
community	1
dr	1
seward	1
is	1
loved	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
household	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
but	1
even	1
by	1
his	1
patients	1
who	1
being	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
hardly	1
in	1
mental	1
equilibrium	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
distort	1
causes	1
and	1
effects	1
since	1
i	1
myself	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
inmate	1
of	1
a	1
lunatic	1
asylum	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
notice	1
that	1
the	1
sophistic	1
tendencies	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
inmates	1
lean	1
towards	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
non	1
causa	1
and	1
ignoratio	1
elenchi	1
i	1
positively	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes	1
at	1
this	1
new	1
development	1
here	1
was	1
my	1
own	1
pet	1
lunatic	1
the	1
most	1
pronounced	1
of	1
his	1
type	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
met	1
with	1
talking	1
elemental	1
philosophy	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
polished	1
gentleman	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
presence	1
which	1
had	1
touched	1
some	1
chord	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
if	1
this	1
new	1
phase	1
was	1
spontaneous	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
unconscious	1
influence	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
rare	1
gift	1
or	1
power	1
we	1
continued	1
to	1
talk	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seemingly	1
quite	1
reasonable	1
she	1
ventured	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
questioningly	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
favourite	1
topic	1
i	1
was	1
again	1
astonished	1
for	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
the	1
impartiality	1
of	1
the	1
completest	1
sanity	1
he	1
even	1
took	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
example	1
when	1
he	1
mentioned	1
certain	1
things	1
why	1
i	1
myself	1
am	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
belief	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
my	1
friends	1
were	1
alarmed	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
my	1
being	1
put	1
under	1
control	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
positive	1
and	1
perpetual	1
entity	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
consuming	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
live	1
things	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
creation	1
one	1
might	1
indefinitely	1
prolong	1
life	1
at	1
times	1
i	1
held	1
the	1
belief	1
so	1
strongly	1
that	1
i	1
actually	1
tried	1
to	1
take	1
human	1
life	1
the	1
doctor	1
here	1
will	1
bear	1
me	1
out	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
occasion	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
strengthening	1
my	1
vital	1
powers	1
by	1
the	1
assimilation	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
his	1
bloodrelying	1
of	1
course	1
upon	1
the	1
scriptual	1
phrase	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
though	1
indeed	1
the	1
vendor	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
nostrum	1
has	1
vulgarised	1
the	1
truism	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
contempt	1
isnt	1
that	1
true	1
doctor	1
i	1
nodded	1
assent	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
amazed	1
that	1
i	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
either	1
think	1
or	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
eat	1
up	1
his	1
spiders	1
and	1
flies	1
not	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
looking	1
at	1
my	1
watch	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
to	1
meet	1
van	1
helsing	1
so	1
i	1
told	1
mrs	1
harker	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
leave	1
she	1
came	1
at	1
once	1
after	1
saying	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
mr	1
renfield	1
goodbye	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
may	1
see	1
you	1
often	1
under	1
auspices	1
pleasanter	1
to	1
yourself	1
to	1
which	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment	1
he	1
replied	1
goodbye	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
pray	1
god	1
i	1
may	1
never	1
see	1
your	1
sweet	1
face	1
again	1
may	1
he	1
bless	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
to	1
meet	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
boys	1
behind	1
me	1
poor	1
art	1
seemed	1
more	1
cheerful	1
than	1

been	1
since	1
lucy	1

been	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
day	1
van	1
helsing	1
stepped	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
the	1
eager	1
nimbleness	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
rushed	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
saying	1

tomorrow	1

say	1
goodbye	1
to	1
this	1

and	1
we	1
go	1
alone	1
i	1
agreed	1
heartily	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
we	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
absence	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
dracula	1
had	1
bought	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
one	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
concern	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
him	1
oh	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
known	1
it	1
before	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
then	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
reached	1
him	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
save	1
poor	1
lucy	1
however	1
the	1
milk	1
that	1
is	1
spilt	1
cries	1
not	1
out	1
afterwards	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
go	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
then	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
silence	1
that	1
lasted	1
till	1
we	1
entered	1
my	1
own	1
gateway	1
before	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
dinner	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
mrs	1
harker	1
i	1
am	1
told	1
madam	1
mina	1
by	1
my	1
friend	1
john	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
husband	1
have	1
put	1
up	1
in	1
exact	1
order	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
moment	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
moment	1
professor	1
she	1
said	1
impulsively	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
morning	1
but	1
why	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
hitherto	1
how	1
good	1
light	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
have	1
made	1
we	1
have	1
told	1
our	1
secrets	1
and	1
yet	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
told	1
is	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
it	1
mrs	1
harker	1
began	1
to	1
blush	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
paper	1
from	1
her	1
pockets	1
she	1
said	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
will	1
you	1
read	1
this	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
go	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
record	1
of	1
today	1
i	1
too	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
putting	1
down	1
at	1
present	1
everything	1
however	1
trivial	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
in	1
this	1
except	1
what	1
is	1
personal	1
must	1
it	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
professor	1
read	1
it	1
over	1
gravely	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
back	1
saying	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
pray	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
it	1
can	1
but	1
make	1
your	1
husband	1
love	1
you	1
the	1
more	1
and	1
all	1
us	1
your	1

more	1
honour	1
you	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
esteem	1
and	1
love	1
she	1
took	1
it	1
back	1
with	1
another	1
blush	1
and	1
a	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
hour	1
all	1
the	1
records	1
we	1
have	1
are	1
complete	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
professor	1
took	1
away	1
one	1
copy	1
to	1
study	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
before	1
our	1

we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
informed	1
as	1
to	1

we	1

in	1

two	1
hours	1
after	1
dinner	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
six	1
oclock	1
we	1
unconsciously	1
formed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
board	1
or	1
committee	1
professor	1
van	1
helsing	1
took	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
which	1
dr	1
seward	1
motioned	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
made	1
me	1
sit	1
next	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
secretary	1
jonathan	1
sat	1
next	1
to	1
me	1

being	1
next	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
dr	1
seward	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
the	1
professor	1
said	1
i	1
may	1
i	1
suppose	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
facts	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
these	1
papers	1
we	1
all	1
expressed	1
assent	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
then	1
it	1
were	1
i	1
think	1
good	1
that	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
enemy	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
i	1
shall	1
then	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
ascertained	1
for	1
me	1
so	1
we	1
then	1
can	1
discuss	1
how	1
we	1
shall	1
act	1
and	1
can	1
take	1
our	1
measure	1
according	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
beings	1
as	1
vampires	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
have	1
evidence	1
that	1

we	1
not	1
the	1

unhappy	1
experience	1
the	1
teachings	1
and	1
the	1
records	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
give	1
proof	1
enough	1
for	1
sane	1
peoples	1
i	1
admit	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
i	1
was	1

were	1
it	1
not	1

myself	1
to	1

the	1
first	1
what	1
now	1

at	1

so	1
precious	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
spared	1
to	1
many	1

that	1

is	1

it	1
is	1
a	1

life	1
is	1
nothings	1
i	1
heed	1
him	1
not	1
but	1
to	1
fail	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
mere	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
become	1
as	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
henceforward	1
become	1
foul	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
like	1
him	1
without	1

them	1
to	1
us	1
again	1
we	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
all	1
time	1
abhorred	1
by	1
all	1
a	1

on	1

we	1
are	1

whilst	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
jonathan	1
had	1
taken	1
my	1
hand	1

feared	1
oh	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
appalling	1
nature	1
of	1
our	1
danger	1
was	1
overcoming	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
his	1
hand	1
stretch	1
out	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
life	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
feel	1
its	1
touch	1
so	1
strong	1
so	1
selfreliant	1
so	1
resolute	1
a	1
brave	1
mans	1
hand	1

speak	1
for	1

not	1

when	1
the	1

my	1

looked	1
in	1
my	1

there	1
was	1
no	1

held	1
out	1
his	1

as	1
we	1
all	1
took	1

our	1
solemn	1

was	1
made	1
i	1

my	1

it	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
occur	1
to	1

to	1
draw	1
back	1
we	1
resumed	1
our	1

dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
serious	1
work	1
had	1
begun	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1

businesslike	1
a	1

as	1
any	1
other	1

of	1
life	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
contend	1
against	1
but	1
we	1
too	1
are	1
not	1
without	1
strength	1
we	1
have	1
on	1
our	1
side	1
power	1
of	1
combination	1
a	1
power	1
denied	1
to	1
the	1
vampire	1
kind	1
we	1
have	1
sources	1
of	1
science	1
we	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
act	1

think	1
and	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
are	1
ours	1
equally	1
in	1
fact	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
our	1
powers	1
extend	1
they	1
are	1
unfettered	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
we	1
have	1
selfdevotion	1
in	1
a	1

and	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
achieve	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
a	1

one	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
much	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
general	1
powers	1
arrayed	1
against	1
us	1
are	1
restrict	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
individual	1
cannot	1
in	1
fine	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
the	1
limitations	1
of	1
the	1
vampire	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
in	1
particular	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
upon	1
are	1
traditions	1
and	1
superstitions	1
these	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
appear	1
much	1
when	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
nay	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
either	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
yet	1
must	1
we	1
be	1
satisfied	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
other	1
means	1
is	1
at	1
our	1
control	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
tradition	1
and	1
superstition	1
are	1
everything	1
does	1
not	1
the	1
belief	1
in	1
vampires	1
rest	1
for	1
others	1
though	1
not	1
alas	1
for	1
us	1
on	1
them	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
have	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
possibility	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
our	1
scientific	1
sceptical	1
matteroffact	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
we	1
even	1
scouted	1
a	1
belief	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
justified	1
under	1
our	1
very	1
eyes	1
take	1
it	1
then	1
that	1
the	1
vampire	1
and	1
the	1
belief	1
in	1
his	1
limitations	1
and	1
his	1
cure	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
base	1
for	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
known	1
everywhere	1
that	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
old	1
greece	1
in	1
old	1
rome	1
he	1
nourish	1
in	1
germany	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
france	1
in	1
india	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
chersonese	1
and	1
in	1
china	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
ways	1
there	1
even	1
is	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
peoples	1
fear	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
day	1
he	1
have	1
follow	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1

the	1
devilbegotten	1
hun	1
the	1
slav	1
the	1
saxon	1
the	1

so	1
far	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
we	1
may	1
act	1
upon	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
very	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
beliefs	1
are	1
justified	1
by	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
so	1
unhappy	1
experience	1
the	1
vampire	1
live	1
on	1
and	1
cannot	1
die	1
by	1
mere	1
passing	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
can	1
flourish	1
when	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
fatten	1
on	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
even	1
more	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
amongst	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
even	1
grow	1
younger	1
that	1
his	1
vital	1
faculties	1
grow	1
strenuous	1
and	1
seem	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
refresh	1
themselves	1
when	1
his	1
special	1
pabulum	1
is	1
plenty	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
flourish	1
without	1
this	1
diet	1
he	1
eat	1
not	1
as	1
others	1
even	1
friend	1
jonathan	1
who	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
weeks	1
did	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
never	1
he	1
throws	1
no	1
shadow	1
he	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
no	1
reflect	1
as	1
again	1
jonathan	1
observe	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
witness	1
again	1
jonathan	1
when	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
against	1
the	1
wolfs	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
help	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
diligence	1
too	1
he	1
can	1
transform	1
himself	1
to	1
wolf	1
as	1
we	1
gather	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
arrival	1
in	1
whitby	1
when	1
he	1
tear	1
open	1
the	1
dog	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
as	1
bat	1
as	1
madam	1
mina	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
whitby	1
and	1
as	1
friend	1
john	1
saw	1
him	1
fly	1
from	1
this	1
so	1
near	1
house	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
friend	1
quincey	1
saw	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
miss	1
lucy	1
he	1
can	1
come	1
in	1
mist	1
which	1
he	1
create	1
that	1
noble	1
ships	1
captain	1
proved	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
from	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
distance	1
he	1
can	1
make	1
this	1
mist	1
is	1
limited	1
and	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
round	1
himself	1
he	1
come	1
on	1
moonlight	1
rays	1
as	1
elemental	1
dust	1
as	1
again	1
jonathan	1
saw	1
those	1
sisters	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
dracula	1
he	1
become	1
so	1
small	1
we	1
ourselves	1
saw	1
miss	1
lucy	1
ere	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
slip	1
through	1
a	1
hairbreadth	1
space	1
at	1
the	1
tomb	1
door	1
he	1
can	1
when	1
once	1
he	1
find	1
his	1
way	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
anything	1
or	1
into	1
anything	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
close	1
it	1
be	1
bound	1
or	1
even	1
fused	1
up	1
with	1
firesolder	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
he	1
can	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
no	1
small	1
power	1
this	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
half	1
shut	1
from	1
the	1
light	1
ah	1
but	1
hear	1
me	1
through	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
yet	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
free	1
nay	1
he	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
prisoner	1
than	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
than	1
the	1
madman	1
in	1
his	1

he	1
cannot	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
lists	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
nature	1
has	1
yet	1
to	1
obey	1
some	1
of	1
natures	1
laws	1
why	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
enter	1
anywhere	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
unless	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
who	1
bid	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
though	1
afterwards	1
he	1
can	1
come	1
as	1
he	1
please	1
his	1
power	1
ceases	1
as	1
does	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
evil	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
only	1
at	1
certain	1
times	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
limited	1
freedom	1
if	1
ire	1
be	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
he	1
is	1
bound	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
change	1
himself	1
at	1
noon	1
or	1
at	1
exact	1
sunrise	1
or	1
sunset	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
we	1
told	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
record	1
of	1
ours	1
we	1
have	1
proof	1
by	1
inference	1
thus	1
whereas	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
will	1
within	1
his	1
limit	1
when	1
he	1
have	1
his	1
earthhome	1
his	1
coffinhome	1
his	1
hellhome	1
the	1
place	1
unhallowed	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
the	1
suicide	1
at	1
whitby	1
still	1
at	1
other	1
time	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
change	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
pass	1
running	1
water	1
at	1
the	1
slack	1
or	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
the	1
tide	1
then	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
which	1
so	1
afflict	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
power	1
as	1
the	1
garlic	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
things	1
scared	1
as	1
this	1
symbol	1
my	1
crucifix	1
that	1
was	1
amongst	1
us	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
we	1
resolve	1
to	1
them	1
he	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
presence	1
he	1
take	1
his	1
place	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
silent	1
with	1
respect	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
too	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
lest	1
in	1
our	1
seeking	1
we	1
may	1
need	1
them	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
wild	1
rose	1
on	1
his	1
coffin	1
keep	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
move	1
not	1
from	1
it	1
a	1
sacred	1
bullet	1
fired	1
into	1
the	1
coffin	1
kill	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
true	1
dead	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
stake	1
through	1
him	1
we	1
know	1
already	1
of	1
its	1
peace	1
or	1
the	1
cutoff	1
head	1
that	1
giveth	1
rest	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
with	1
our	1
eyes	1
thus	1
when	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
this	1
manthatwas	1
we	1
can	1
confine	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
coffin	1
and	1
destroy	1
him	1
if	1
we	1
obey	1
what	1
we	1
know	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
clever	1
i	1
have	1
asked	1
my	1
friend	1
arminius	1
of	1
budapesth	1
university	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
record	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
means	1
that	1
are	1
he	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
seen	1
he	1
must	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
voivode	1
dracula	1
who	1
won	1
his	1
name	1
against	1
the	1
turk	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
frontier	1
of	1
turkeyland	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
so	1
then	1
was	1
he	1
no	1
common	1
man	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
for	1
centuries	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
cleverest	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
cunning	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
bravest	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
beyond	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
mighty	1
brain	1
and	1
that	1
iron	1
resolution	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
grave	1
and	1
are	1
even	1
now	1
arrayed	1
against	1
us	1
the	1
draculas	1
were	1
says	1
arminius	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
noble	1
race	1
though	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
were	1
scions	1
who	1
were	1
held	1
by	1
their	1

spoken	1
of	1

which	1
we	1
all	1
understand	1
too	1
well	1
there	1

alone	1

can	1
dwell	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
its	1
terrors	1
that	1
this	1
evil	1
thing	1
is	1
rooted	1
deep	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
in	1
soil	1
barren	1
of	1
holy	1
memories	1
it	1
cannot	1
rest	1
whilst	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
mr	1
morris	1
was	1
looking	1
steadily	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
he	1
now	1
got	1
up	1
quietly	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
pause	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
professor	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
settle	1
what	1
we	1
do	1
we	1
have	1
here	1
much	1
data	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
proceed	1
to	1
lay	1
out	1
our	1
campaign	1
we	1
know	1
from	1
the	1
inquiry	1
of	1
jonathan	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
castle	1
to	1
whitby	1
came	1
fifty	1
boxes	1
of	1
earth	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
delivered	1
at	1
carfax	1
we	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
boxes	1
have	1
been	1
removed	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
the	1
that	1
our	1
first	1
step	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
beyond	1
that	1
wall	1
where	1
we	1
look	1
today	1
or	1
whether	1
any	1
more	1
have	1
been	1
removed	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
we	1
must	1
trace	1
here	1
we	1
were	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
startling	1
way	1
outside	1
the	1
house	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
pistol	1
shot	1
the	1
glass	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
was	1
shattered	1
with	1
a	1
bullet	1
which	1
ricochetting	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
embrasure	1
struck	1
the	1
far	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
i	1
am	1
at	1
heart	1
a	1
coward	1
for	1
i	1
shrieked	1
out	1
the	1
men	1
all	1
jumped	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
lord	1
godalming	1
flew	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
threw	1
up	1
the	1
sash	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
we	1
heard	1
mr	1
morriss	1
voice	1
without	1
sorry	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
have	1
alarmed	1
you	1
i	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
it	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
idiotic	1
thing	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
i	1
ask	1
your	1
pardon	1
mrs	1
harker	1
most	1
sincerely	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
frightened	1
you	1
terribly	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
whilst	1
the	1
professor	1
was	1
talking	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
big	1
bat	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
windowsill	1
i	1
have	1
got	1
such	1
a	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
damned	1
brutes	1
from	1
recent	1
events	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
stand	1
then	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
shot	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
doing	1
of	1
late	1
of	1
evenings	1
whenever	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
one	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
me	1
for	1
it	1
then	1
art	1
did	1
you	1
hit	1
it	1
asked	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
i	1
fancy	1
not	1
for	1
it	1
flew	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
without	1
saying	1
any	1
more	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
began	1
to	1
resume	1
his	1
statement	1
we	1
must	1
trace	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
boxes	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
we	1
must	1
either	1
capture	1
or	1
kill	1
this	1
monster	1
in	1
his	1
lair	1
or	1
we	1
must	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
sterilise	1
the	1
earth	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
more	1
he	1
can	1
seek	1
safety	1
in	1
it	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
we	1
may	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
form	1
of	1
man	1
between	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
noon	1
and	1
sunset	1
and	1
so	1
engage	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
most	1
weak	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
you	1
madam	1
mina	1
this	1
night	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
until	1
all	1
be	1
well	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
precious	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
risk	1
when	1
we	1
part	1
tonight	1
you	1
no	1
more	1
must	1
question	1
we	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
we	1
are	1
men	1
and	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
our	1
star	1
and	1
our	1
hope	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
act	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
free	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
danger	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
even	1
jonathan	1
seemed	1
relieved	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
good	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
brave	1
danger	1
and	1
perhaps	1
lessen	1
their	1
safety	1
strength	1
being	1
the	1
best	1
safety	1
through	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
but	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
made	1
up	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bitter	1
pill	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
swallow	1
i	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
save	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
chivalrous	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
mr	1
morris	1
resumed	1
the	1
discussion	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
i	1
vote	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
right	1
now	1
time	1
is	1
everything	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
swift	1
action	1
on	1
our	1
part	1
may	1
save	1
another	1
victim	1
i	1
own	1
that	1
my	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
fail	1
me	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
action	1
came	1
so	1
close	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
greater	1
fear	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
appeared	1
as	1
a	1
drag	1
or	1
a	1
hindrance	1
to	1
their	1
work	1
they	1
might	1
even	1
leave	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
counsels	1
altogether	1
they	1
have	1
now	1
gone	1
off	1
to	1
carfax	1
with	1
means	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
manlike	1
they	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
sleep	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
sleep	1
when	1
those	1
she	1
loves	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
i	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
pretend	1
to	1
sleep	1
lest	1
jonathan	1
have	1
added	1
anxiety	1
about	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
returns	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
1	1
october	1
4	1
am	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
an	1
urgent	1
message	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
renfield	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
i	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
told	1
the	1
messenger	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
attend	1
to	1
his	1
wishes	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
was	1
busy	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
attendant	1
added	1
he	1
seems	1
very	1
importunate	1
sir	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
so	1
eager	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
but	1
what	1
if	1
you	1
dont	1
see	1
him	1
soon	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
violent	1
fits	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
this	1
without	1
some	1
cause	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
all	1
right	1
ill	1
go	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
asked	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
wait	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
patient	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
friend	1
john	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
his	1
case	1
in	1
your	1
diary	1
interest	1
me	1
much	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
bearing	1
too	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
on	1
our	1
case	1
i	1
should	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
especial	1
when	1
his	1
mind	1
is	1
disturbed	1
may	1
i	1
come	1
also	1
asked	1
lord	1
godalming	1
me	1
too	1
said	1
quincey	1
morris	1
may	1
i	1
come	1
said	1
harker	1
i	1
nodded	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
together	1
we	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
considerable	1
excitement	1
but	1
far	1
more	1
rational	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
and	1
manner	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
unusual	1
understanding	1
of	1
himself	1
which	1
was	1
unlike	1
anything	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
a	1
lunatic	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
that	1
his	1
reasons	1
would	1
prevail	1
with	1
others	1
entirely	1
sane	1
we	1
all	1
four	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
at	1
first	1
said	1
anything	1
his	1
request	1
was	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
release	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
asylum	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
home	1
this	1
he	1
backed	1
up	1
with	1
arguments	1
regarding	1
his	1
complete	1
recovery	1
and	1
adduced	1
his	1
own	1
existing	1
sanity	1
i	1
appeal	1
to	1
your	1
friends	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
will	1
perhaps	1
not	1
mind	1
sitting	1
in	1
judgment	1
on	1
my	1
case	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
introduced	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
astonished	1
that	1
the	1
oddness	1
of	1
introducing	1
a	1
madman	1
in	1
an	1
asylum	1
did	1
not	1
strike	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
besides	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
dignity	1
in	1
the	1
mans	1
manner	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
equality	1
that	1
i	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
the	1
introduction	1
lord	1
godalming	1
professor	1
van	1
helsing	1
mr	1
quincey	1
morris	1
of	1
texas	1
mr	1
renfield	1
he	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
saying	1
in	1
turn	1
lord	1
godalming	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seconding	1
your	1
father	1
at	1
the	1
windham	1
i	1
grieve	1
to	1
know	1
by	1
your	1
holding	1
the	1
title	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
loved	1
and	1
honoured	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
was	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
inventor	1
of	1
a	1
burnt	1
rum	1
punch	1
much	1
patronised	1
on	1
derby	1
night	1
mr	1
morris	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
state	1
its	1
reception	1
into	1
the	1
union	1
was	1
a	1
precedent	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
farreaching	1
effects	1
hereafter	1
when	1
the	1
pole	1
and	1
the	1
tropics	1
may	1
hold	1
alliance	1
to	1
the	1
stars	1

will	1
deem	1
it	1
a	1
moral	1
duty	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
under	1
exceptional	1
circumstances	1
he	1
made	1
this	1
last	1
appeal	1
with	1
a	1
courtly	1
air	1
of	1
conviction	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
own	1
charm	1
i	1
think	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
staggered	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
i	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
conviction	1
despite	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
mans	1
character	1
and	1
history	1
that	1
his	1
reason	1
had	1
been	1
restored	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
under	1
a	1
strong	1
impulse	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
satisfied	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
sanity	1
and	1
would	1
see	1
about	1
the	1
necessary	1
formalities	1
for	1
his	1
release	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
however	1
before	1
making	1
so	1
grave	1
a	1
statement	1
for	1
of	1
old	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
sudden	1
changes	1
to	1
which	1
this	1
particular	1
patient	1
was	1
liable	1
so	1
i	1
contented	1
myself	1
with	1
making	1
a	1
general	1
statement	1
that	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
improving	1
very	1
rapidly	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
longer	1
chat	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
would	1
then	1
see	1
what	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
meeting	1
his	1
wishes	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
satisfy	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
quickly	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
dr	1
seward	1
that	1
you	1
hardly	1
apprehend	1
my	1
wish	1
i	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
once	1
here	1
now	1
this	1
very	1
hour	1
this	1
very	1
moment	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
time	1
presses	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
implied	1
agreement	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
scytheman	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
contract	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
to	1
put	1
before	1
so	1
admirable	1
a	1
practitioner	1
as	1
dr	1
seward	1
so	1
simple	1
yet	1
so	1
momentous	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
ensure	1
its	1
fulfilment	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
keenly	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
negative	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
scrutinised	1
them	1
closely	1
not	1
meeting	1
any	1
sufficient	1
response	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
erred	1
in	1
my	1
supposition	1
you	1
have	1
i	1
said	1
frankly	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
i	1
felt	1
brutally	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
slowly	1
then	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
must	1
only	1
shift	1
my	1
ground	1
of	1
request	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
for	1
this	1
concession	1
boon	1
privilege	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
implore	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
not	1
on	1
personal	1
grounds	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
others	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
my	1
reasons	1
but	1
you	1
may	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
good	1
ones	1
sound	1
and	1
unselfish	1
and	1
springing	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
could	1
you	1
look	1
sir	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
you	1
would	1
approve	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
the	1
sentiments	1
which	1
animate	1
me	1
nay	1
more	1
you	1
would	1
count	1
me	1
amongst	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
truest	1
of	1
your	1
friends	1
again	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
us	1
all	1
keenly	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
growing	1
conviction	1
that	1
this	1
sudden	1
change	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
intellectual	1
method	1
was	1
but	1
yet	1
another	1
form	1
or	1
phase	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
and	1
so	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
knowing	1
from	1
experience	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
all	1
lunatics	1
give	1
himself	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
intensity	1
his	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
almost	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
fixed	1
concentration	1
of	1
his	1
look	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
renfield	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
surprise	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
only	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
addressing	1
an	1
equal	1
can	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
frankly	1
your	1
real	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
tonight	1
i	1
will	1
undertake	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
satisfy	1
even	1
me	1
a	1
stranger	1
without	1
prejudice	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
keeping	1
an	1
open	1
mind	1
dr	1
seward	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
risk	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
responsibility	1
the	1
privilege	1
you	1
seek	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
poignant	1
regret	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
professor	1
went	1
on	1
come	1
sir	1
bethink	1
yourself	1
you	1
claim	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
since	1
you	1
seek	1
to	1
impress	1
us	1
with	1
your	1
complete	1
reasonableness	1
you	1
do	1
this	1
whose	1
sanity	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
released	1
from	1
medical	1
treatment	1
for	1
this	1
very	1
defect	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
effort	1
to	1
choose	1
the	1
wisest	1
course	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
perform	1
the	1
duty	1
which	1
you	1
yourself	1
put	1
upon	1
us	1
be	1

and	1
help	1
us	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
we	1
shall	1
aid	1
you	1
to	1
achieve	1
your	1
wish	1
he	1
still	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
your	1
argument	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
speak	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
hesitate	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
my	1
own	1
master	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
i	1
can	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
trust	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
refused	1
the	1
responsibility	1
does	1
not	1
rest	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
time	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
scene	1
which	1
was	1
becoming	1
too	1
comically	1
grave	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
simply	1
saying	1
come	1
my	1
friends	1
we	1
have	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
goodnight	1
as	1
however	1
i	1
got	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
a	1
new	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
patient	1
he	1
moved	1
towards	1
me	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
another	1
homicidal	1
attack	1
my	1
fears	1
however	1
were	1
groundless	1
for	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
two	1
hands	1
imploringly	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
petition	1
in	1
a	1
moving	1
manner	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
excess	1
of	1
his	1
emotion	1
was	1
militating	1
against	1
him	1
by	1
restoring	1
us	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
old	1
relations	1
he	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
demonstrative	1
i	1
glanced	1
at	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
conviction	1
reflected	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
so	1
i	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
fixed	1
in	1
my	1
manner	1
if	1
not	1
more	1
stern	1
and	1
motioned	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
efforts	1
were	1
unavailing	1
i	1
had	1
previously	1
seen	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
constantly	1
growing	1
excitement	1
in	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
request	1
of	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
much	1
such	1
for	1
instance	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
cat	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
collapse	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
sullen	1
acquiescence	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
my	1
expectation	1
was	1
not	1
realised	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
appeal	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
successful	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
quite	1
a	1
frantic	1
condition	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
wringing	1
them	1
in	1
plaintive	1
supplication	1
and	1
poured	1
forth	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
entreaty	1
with	1
the	1
tears	1
rolling	1
down	1
his	1
cheeks	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
and	1
form	1
expressive	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
emotion	1
let	1
me	1
entreat	1
you	1
dr	1
seward	1
oh	1
let	1
me	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
at	1
once	1
send	1
me	1
away	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
and	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
send	1
keepers	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
whips	1
and	1
chains	1

them	1
take	1
me	1
in	1

that	1

longer	1
this	1
went	1
on	1
the	1

he	1
would	1

and	1
so	1
would	1
bring	1
on	1
a	1
fit	1
so	1
i	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1

no	1

we	1

to	1
your	1

and	1
try	1
to	1

more	1

he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
intently	1
for	1
several	1
moments	1
then	1
without	1
a	1

he	1
rose	1
and	1

was	1

i	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
the	1
search	1
with	1
an	1
easy	1
mind	1
for	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
mina	1
so	1
absolutely	1
strong	1
and	1
well	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
that	1
she	1
consented	1
to	1
hold	1
back	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
men	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
somehow	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dread	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
fearful	1
business	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
her	1
work	1
is	1
done	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
energy	1
and	1
brains	1
and	1
foresight	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
is	1
put	1
together	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
every	1
point	1
tells	1
she	1
may	1
well	1
feel	1
that	1
her	1
part	1
is	1
finished	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
can	1
henceforth	1
leave	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
were	1
i	1
think	1
all	1
a	1
little	1
upset	1
by	1
the	1
scene	1
with	1
mr	1
renfield	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
room	1
we	1
were	1
silent	1
till	1
we	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
then	1
mr	1
morris	1
said	1
to	1
dr	1

say	1
jack	1
if	1
that	1
man	1
wasnt	1
attempting	1
a	1
bluff	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
sanest	1
lunatic	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
im	1
not	1
sure	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
serious	1
purpose	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
was	1
pretty	1
rough	1
on	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
silent	1
but	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
added	1
friend	1
john	1
you	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
lunatics	1
than	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
im	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
decide	1
i	1
would	1
before	1
that	1
last	1
hysterical	1
outburst	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
free	1
but	1
we	1
live	1
and	1
learn	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
present	1
task	1
we	1
must	1
take	1
no	1
chance	1
as	1
my	1
friend	1
quincey	1
would	1
say	1
all	1
is	1
best	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
dr	1
seward	1
seemed	1
to	1
answer	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
dreamy	1
kind	1
of	1
way	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
if	1
that	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
ordinary	1
lunatic	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
my	1
chance	1
of	1
trusting	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
seems	1
so	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
an	1
indexy	1
kind	1
of	1
way	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
wrong	1
by	1
helping	1
his	1
fads	1
i	1
cant	1
forget	1
how	1
he	1
prayed	1
with	1
almost	1
equal	1
fervour	1
for	1
a	1
cat	1
and	1
then	1
tried	1
to	1
tear	1
my	1
throat	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
teeth	1
besides	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
count	1
lord	1
and	1
master	1
and	1
he	1
may	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
diabolical	1
way	1
that	1
horrid	1
thing	1
has	1
the	1
wolves	1
and	1
the	1
rats	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
kind	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
isnt	1
above	1
trying	1
to	1
use	1
a	1
respectable	1
lunatic	1
he	1
certainly	1
did	1
seem	1
earnest	1
though	1
i	1
only	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
work	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
hand	1
help	1
to	1
unnerve	1
a	1
man	1
the	1
professor	1
stepped	1
over	1
and	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
grave	1
kindly	1
way	1
friend	1
john	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
we	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
duty	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
sad	1
and	1
terrible	1
case	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
do	1
as	1
we	1
deem	1
best	1
what	1
else	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
except	1
the	1
pity	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
god	1
lord	1
godalming	1
had	1
slipped	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
returned	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
silver	1
whistle	1
as	1
he	1
remarked	1
that	1
old	1
place	1
may	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
rats	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
ive	1
got	1
an	1
antidote	1
on	1
call	1
having	1
passed	1
the	1
wall	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
taking	1
care	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
lawn	1
when	1
the	1
moonlight	1
shone	1
out	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
the	1
professor	1
opened	1
his	1
bag	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
sorting	1
them	1
into	1
four	1
little	1
groups	1
evidently	1
one	1
for	1
each	1
then	1
he	1
spoke	1
my	1
friends	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
into	1
a	1
terrible	1
danger	1
and	1
we	1
need	1
arms	1
of	1
many	1
kinds	1
our	1
enemy	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
spiritual	1
remember	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
twenty	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
our	1
necks	1
or	1
our	1
windpipes	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
kind	1
and	1
therefore	1
breakable	1
or	1
crushable	1
his	1
are	1
not	1
amenable	1
to	1
mere	1
strength	1
a	1
stronger	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
more	1
strong	1
in	1
all	1
than	1
him	1
can	1
at	1
certain	1
times	1
hold	1
him	1
but	1
yet	1
they	1
cannot	1
hurt	1
him	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
him	1
we	1
must	1
therefore	1
guard	1
ourselves	1
from	1
his	1
touch	1
keep	1
this	1
near	1
your	1
heart	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
lifted	1
a	1
little	1
silver	1
crucifix	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
being	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
put	1
these	1
flowers	1
round	1
your	1
neck	1
here	1
he	1
handed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
wreath	1
of	1
withered	1
garlic	1
blossoms	1
for	1
other	1
enemies	1
more	1
mundane	1
this	1
revolver	1
and	1
this	1
knife	1
and	1
for	1
aid	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
small	1
electric	1
lamps	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
fasten	1
to	1
your	1
breast	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
this	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
desecrate	1
needless	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
sacred	1
wafer	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
envelope	1
and	1
handed	1
to	1
me	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
similarly	1
equipped	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
friend	1
john	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
skeleton	1
keys	1
if	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
break	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
window	1
as	1
before	1
at	1
miss	1
lucys	1
dr	1
seward	1
tried	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
skeleton	1
keys	1
his	1
mechanical	1
dexterity	1
as	1
a	1
surgeon	1
standing	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
stead	1
presently	1
he	1
got	1
one	1
to	1
suit	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
play	1
back	1
and	1
forward	1
the	1
bolt	1
yielded	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rusty	1
clang	1
shot	1
back	1
we	1
pressed	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
rusty	1
hinges	1
creaked	1
and	1
it	1
slowly	1
opened	1
it	1
was	1
startlingly	1
like	1
the	1
image	1
conveyed	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
of	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
miss	1
westenras	1
tomb	1
i	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
idea	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
others	1
for	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
they	1
shrank	1
back	1
the	1
professor	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
move	1
forward	1
and	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
in	1
manus	1
tuas	1
domine	1
he	1
said	1
crossing	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
threshold	1
we	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
us	1
lest	1
when	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
lit	1
our	1
lamps	1
we	1
should	1
possibly	1
attract	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
professor	1
carefully	1
tried	1
the	1
lock	1
lest	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
from	1
within	1
should	1
we	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
making	1
our	1
exit	1
then	1
we	1
all	1
lit	1
our	1
lamps	1
and	1
proceeded	1
on	1
our	1
search	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
tiny	1
lamps	1
fell	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
odd	1
forms	1
as	1
the	1
rays	1
crossed	1
each	1
other	1
or	1
the	1
opacity	1
of	1
our	1
bodies	1
threw	1
great	1
shadows	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
life	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
amongst	1
us	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
recollection	1
so	1
powerfully	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
grim	1
surroundings	1
of	1
that	1
terrible	1
experience	1
in	1
transylvania	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
feeling	1
was	1
common	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
for	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
kept	1
looking	1
over	1
their	1
shoulders	1
at	1
every	1
sound	1
and	1
every	1
new	1
shadow	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
felt	1
myself	1
doing	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
was	1
thick	1
with	1
dust	1
the	1
floor	1
was	1
seemingly	1
inches	1
deep	1
except	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
recent	1
footsteps	1
in	1
which	1
on	1
holding	1
down	1
my	1
lamp	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
marks	1
of	1
hobnails	1
where	1
the	1
dust	1
was	1
cracked	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
fluffy	1
and	1
heavy	1
with	1
dust	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
were	1
masses	1
of	1
spiders	1
webs	1
whereon	1
the	1
dust	1
had	1
gathered	1
till	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
old	1
tattered	1
rags	1
as	1
the	1
weight	1
had	1
torn	1
them	1
partly	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
bunch	1
of	1
keys	1
with	1
a	1
timeyellowed	1
label	1
on	1
each	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
several	1
times	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
were	1
several	1
similar	1
rents	1
in	1
the	1
blanket	1
of	1
dust	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
exposed	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
lifted	1
them	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
place	1
jonathan	1
you	1
have	1
copied	1
maps	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
at	1
least	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
do	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
chapel	1
i	1
had	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
its	1
direction	1
though	1
on	1
my	1
former	1
visit	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
admission	1
to	1
it	1
so	1
i	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
wrong	1
turnings	1
found	1
myself	1
opposite	1
a	1
low	1
arched	1
oaken	1
door	1
ribbed	1
with	1
iron	1
bands	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
spot	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
lamp	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
copied	1
from	1
the	1
file	1
of	1
my	1
original	1
correspondence	1
regarding	1
the	1
purchase	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
trouble	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
key	1
on	1
the	1
bunch	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
we	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
some	1
unpleasantness	1
for	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
a	1
faint	1
malodorous	1
air	1
seemed	1
to	1
exhale	1
through	1
the	1
gaps	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
even	1
expected	1
such	1
an	1
odour	1
as	1
we	1
encountered	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
all	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
fasting	1
stage	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
in	1
his	1
rooms	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gloated	1
with	1
fresh	1
blood	1
in	1
a	1
ruined	1
building	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
air	1
but	1
here	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
small	1
and	1
close	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
disuse	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
air	1
stagnant	1
and	1
foul	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
earthy	1
smell	1
as	1
of	1
some	1
dry	1
miasma	1
which	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
fouler	1
air	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
odour	1
itself	1
now	1
shall	1
i	1
describe	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
alone	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ills	1
of	1
mortality	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pungent	1
acrid	1
smell	1
of	1
blood	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
corruption	1
had	1
become	1
itself	1
corrupt	1
faugh	1
it	1
sickens	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
every	1
breath	1
exhaled	1
by	1
that	1
monster	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
intensified	1
its	1
loathsomeness	1
under	1
ordinary	1
circumstances	1
such	1
a	1
stench	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
our	1
enterprise	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
ordinary	1
case	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
terrible	1
purpose	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
involved	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
strength	1
which	1
rose	1
above	1
merely	1
physical	1
considerations	1
after	1
the	1
involuntary	1
shrinking	1
consequent	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
nauseous	1
whiff	1
we	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
set	1
about	1
our	1
work	1
as	1
though	1
that	1
loathsome	1
place	1
were	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
roses	1
we	1
made	1
an	1
accurate	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
professor	1
saying	1
as	1
we	1
began	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
are	1
left	1
we	1
must	1
then	1
examine	1
every	1
hole	1
and	1
corner	1
and	1
cranny	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
we	1
cannot	1
get	1
some	1
clue	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
a	1
glance	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
many	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
earth	1
chests	1
were	1
bulky	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
them	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
twentynine	1
left	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fifty	1
once	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
fright	1
for	1
seeing	1
lord	1
godalming	1
suddenly	1
turn	1
and	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vaulted	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
passage	1
beyond	1
i	1
looked	1
too	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
my	1
heart	1
stood	1
still	1
somewhere	1
looking	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
shadow	1
i	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
high	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
evil	1
face	1
the	1
ridge	1
of	1
the	1
nose	1
the	1
red	1
eyes	1
the	1
red	1
lips	1
the	1
awful	1
pallor	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
for	1
as	1
lord	1
godalming	1
said	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
face	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
shadows	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
inquiry	1
i	1
turned	1
my	1
lamp	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
and	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
corners	1
no	1
doors	1
no	1
aperture	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
solid	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
hidingplace	1
even	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
that	1
fear	1
had	1
helped	1
imagination	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
i	1
saw	1
morris	1
step	1
suddenly	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
corner	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
examining	1
we	1
all	1
followed	1
his	1
movements	1
with	1
our	1
eyes	1
for	1
undoubtedly	1
some	1
nervousness	1
was	1
growing	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
phosphorescence	1
which	1
twinkled	1
like	1
stars	1
we	1
all	1
instinctively	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
was	1
becoming	1
alive	1
with	1
rats	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
we	1
stood	1
appalled	1
all	1
save	1
lord	1
godalming	1
who	1
was	1
seemingly	1
prepared	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
emergency	1
rushing	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
ironbound	1
oaken	1
door	1
which	1
dr	1
seward	1
had	1
described	1
from	1
the	1
outside	1
and	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
myself	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
lock	1
drew	1
the	1
huge	1
bolts	1
and	1
swung	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
then	1
taking	1
his	1
little	1
silver	1
whistle	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
low	1
shrill	1
call	1
it	1
was	1
answered	1
from	1
behind	1
dr	1
sewards	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
yelping	1
of	1
dogs	1
and	1
after	1
about	1
a	1
minute	1
three	1
terriers	1
came	1
dashing	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
unconsciously	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
moved	1
i	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
dust	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
disturbed	1
the	1
boxes	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
this	1
way	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
minute	1
that	1
had	1
elapsed	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
rats	1
had	1
vastly	1
increased	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
swarm	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
till	1
the	1
lamplight	1
shining	1
on	1
their	1
moving	1
dark	1
bodies	1
and	1
glittering	1
baleful	1
eyes	1
made	1
the	1
place	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
bank	1
of	1
earth	1
set	1
with	1
fireflies	1
the	1
dogs	1
dashed	1
on	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
snarled	1
and	1
then	1
simultaneously	1
lifting	1
their	1
noses	1
began	1
to	1
howl	1
in	1
most	1
lugubrious	1
fashion	1
the	1
rats	1
were	1
multiplying	1
in	1
thousands	1
and	1
we	1
moved	1
out	1
lord	1
godalming	1
lifted	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
and	1
carrying	1
him	1
in	1
placed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
the	1
instant	1
his	1
feet	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
courage	1
and	1
rushed	1
at	1
his	1
natural	1
enemies	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
him	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
shaken	1
the	1
life	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
score	1
the	1
other	1
dogs	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
been	1
lifted	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
had	1
but	1
small	1
prey	1
ere	1
the	1
whole	1
mass	1
had	1
vanished	1
with	1
their	1
going	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
evil	1
presence	1
had	1
departed	1
for	1
the	1
dogs	1
frisked	1
about	1
and	1
barked	1
merrily	1
as	1
they	1
made	1
sudden	1
darts	1
at	1
their	1
prostrate	1
foes	1
and	1
turned	1
them	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
and	1
tossed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
vicious	1
shakes	1
we	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
find	1
our	1
spirits	1
rise	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
deadly	1
atmosphere	1
by	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
chapel	1
door	1
or	1
the	1
relief	1
which	1
we	1
experienced	1
by	1
finding	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
most	1
certainly	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
dread	1
seemed	1
to	1
slip	1
from	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
robe	1
and	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
our	1
coming	1
lost	1
something	1
of	1
its	1
grim	1
significance	1
though	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
slacken	1
a	1
whit	1
in	1
our	1
resolution	1
we	1
closed	1
the	1
outer	1
door	1
and	1
barred	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
and	1
bringing	1
the	1
dogs	1
with	1
us	1
began	1
our	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
we	1
found	1
nothing	1
throughout	1
except	1
dust	1
in	1
extraordinary	1
proportions	1
and	1
all	1
untouched	1
save	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
footsteps	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
made	1
my	1
first	1
visit	1
never	1
once	1
did	1
the	1
dogs	1
exhibit	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
chapel	1
they	1
frisked	1
about	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
rabbithunting	1
in	1
a	1
summer	1
wood	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
quickening	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
when	1
we	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
halldoor	1
from	1
the	1
bunch	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
orthodox	1
fashion	1
putting	1
the	1
key	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
far	1
he	1
said	1
our	1
night	1
has	1
been	1
eminently	1
successful	1
no	1
harm	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
feared	1
might	1
be	1
and	1
yet	1
we	1
have	1
ascertained	1
how	1
many	1
boxes	1
are	1
missing	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
do	1
i	1
rejoice	1
that	1
this	1
our	1
first	1
and	1
perhaps	1
our	1
most	1
difficult	1
and	1
dangerous	1
step	1
has	1
been	1
accomplished	1
without	1
the	1
bringing	1
thereinto	1
our	1
most	1
sweet	1
madam	1
mina	1
or	1
troubling	1
her	1
walking	1
or	1
sleeping	1
thoughts	1
with	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds	1
and	1
smells	1
of	1
horror	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
never	1
forget	1
one	1
lesson	1
too	1
we	1
have	1
learned	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
allowable	1
to	1
argue	1
a	1
particulari	1
that	1
the	1
brute	1
beasts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
the	1
counts	1
command	1
are	1
yet	1
themselves	1
not	1
amenable	1
to	1
his	1
spiritual	1
power	1
for	1
look	1
these	1
rats	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
call	1
just	1
as	1
from	1
his	1
castle	1
top	1
he	1
summon	1
the	1
wolves	1
to	1
your	1

to	1
that	1
poor	1
mothers	1
cry	1
though	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
run	1
pellmell	1
from	1
the	1
so	1
little	1
dogs	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
arthur	1
we	1
have	1
other	1
matters	1
before	1
us	1
other	1
dangers	1
other	1
fears	1
and	1
that	1
monster	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
used	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
brute	1
world	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
or	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
tonight	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
elsewhere	1
good	1
it	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
opportunity	1
to	1
cry	1
check	1
in	1
some	1
ways	1
in	1
this	1
chess	1
game	1
which	1
we	1
play	1
for	1
the	1
stake	1
of	1
human	1
souls	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
home	1
the	1
dawn	1
is	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
our	1
first	1
nights	1
work	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
ordained	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
nights	1
and	1
days	1
to	1
follow	1
if	1
full	1
of	1
peril	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
from	1
no	1
danger	1
shall	1
we	1
shrink	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
silent	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
back	1
save	1
for	1
some	1
poor	1
creature	1
who	1
was	1
screaming	1
away	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
wards	1
and	1
a	1
low	1
moaning	1
sound	1
from	1
renfields	1
room	1
the	1
poor	1
wretch	1
was	1
doubtless	1
torturing	1
himself	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
insane	1
with	1
needless	1
thoughts	1
of	1
pain	1
i	1
came	1
tiptoe	1
into	1
our	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
mina	1
asleep	1
breathing	1
so	1
softly	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
ear	1
down	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
she	1
looks	1
paler	1
than	1
usual	1
i	1
hope	1
the	1
meeting	1
tonight	1
has	1
not	1
upset	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
truly	1
thankful	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
future	1
work	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
our	1
deliberations	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
strain	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
bear	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
better	1
now	1
therefore	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
settled	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
things	1
which	1
would	1
frighten	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
yet	1
to	1
conceal	1
them	1
from	1
her	1
might	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
if	1
once	1
she	1
suspected	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
concealment	1
henceforth	1
our	1
work	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sealed	1
book	1
to	1
her	1
till	1
at	1
least	1
such	1
time	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
finished	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
free	1
from	1
a	1
monster	1
of	1
the	1
nether	1
world	1
i	1
daresay	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
keep	1
silence	1
after	1
such	1
confidence	1
as	1
ours	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
resolute	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
keep	1
dark	1
over	1
tonights	1
doings	1
and	1
shall	1
refuse	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
i	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
her	1
1	1
october	1
later	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
natural	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
all	1
overslept	1
ourselves	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
a	1
busy	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
no	1
rest	1
at	1
all	1
even	1
mina	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
its	1
exhaustion	1
for	1
though	1
i	1
slept	1
till	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
high	1
i	1
was	1
awake	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
before	1
she	1
awoke	1
indeed	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
sound	1
asleep	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
me	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
blank	1
terror	1
as	1
one	1
looks	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
waked	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
dream	1
she	1
complained	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
being	1
tired	1
and	1
i	1
let	1
her	1
rest	1
till	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
now	1
know	1
of	1
twenty	1
one	1
boxes	1
having	1
been	1
removed	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
several	1
were	1
taken	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
removals	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
trace	1
them	1
all	1
such	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
immensely	1
simplify	1
our	1
labour	1
and	1
the	1
sooner	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
better	1
i	1
shall	1
look	1
up	1
thomas	1
snelling	1
today	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
1	1
october	1
it	1
was	1
towards	1
noon	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
professor	1
walking	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
jolly	1
and	1
cheerful	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
evident	1
that	1
last	1
nights	1
work	1
has	1
helped	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
brooding	1
weight	1
off	1
his	1
mind	1
after	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
suddenly	1
said	1
your	1
patient	1
interests	1
me	1
much	1
may	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
visit	1
him	1
this	1
morning	1
or	1
if	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
occupy	1
i	1
can	1
go	1
alone	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
experience	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
lunatic	1
who	1
talk	1
philosophy	1
and	1
reason	1
sound	1
i	1
had	1
some	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
which	1
pressed	1
so	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
alone	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
as	1
then	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
waiting	1
so	1
i	1
called	1
an	1
attendant	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
necessary	1
instructions	1
before	1
the	1
professor	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
cautioned	1
him	1
against	1
getting	1
any	1
false	1
impression	1
from	1
my	1
patient	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
i	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
delusion	1
as	1
to	1
consuming	1
live	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
madam	1
mina	1
as	1
i	1
see	1
in	1
your	1
diary	1
of	1
yesterday	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
belief	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
smile	1
friend	1
john	1
excuse	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
but	1
the	1
answer	1
is	1
here	1
i	1
laid	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
typewritten	1
matter	1
when	1
our	1
sane	1
and	1
learned	1
lunatic	1
made	1
that	1
very	1
statement	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
consume	1
life	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
actually	1
nauseous	1
with	1
the	1
flies	1
and	1
spiders	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
just	1
before	1
mrs	1
harker	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
van	1
helsing	1
smiled	1
in	1
turn	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
your	1
memory	1
is	1
true	1
friend	1
john	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
remembered	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
very	1
obliquity	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
memory	1
which	1
makes	1
mental	1
disease	1
such	1
a	1
fascinating	1
study	1
perhaps	1
i	1
may	1
gain	1
more	1
knowledge	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
this	1
madman	1
than	1
i	1
shall	1
from	1
the	1
teaching	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
wise	1
who	1
knows	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
work	1
and	1
before	1
long	1
was	1
through	1
that	1
in	1
hand	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
short	1
indeed	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
van	1
helsing	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
do	1
i	1
interrupt	1
he	1
asked	1
politely	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
answered	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
work	1
is	1
finished	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
i	1
can	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
now	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
is	1
needless	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
well	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
appraise	1
me	1
at	1
much	1
our	1
interview	1
was	1
short	1
when	1
i	1
entered	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
stool	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
sullen	1
discontent	1
i	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
cheerfully	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
respect	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
assume	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
whatever	1
dont	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
i	1
asked	1
his	1
answer	1
was	1
not	1
reassuring	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
well	1
enough	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
old	1
fool	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
yourself	1
and	1
your	1
idiotic	1
brain	1
theories	1
somewhere	1
else	1
damn	1
all	1
thickheaded	1
dutchmen	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
would	1
he	1
say	1
but	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
implacable	1
sullenness	1
as	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
as	1
though	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
ill	1
the	1
room	1
at	1
all	1
thus	1
departed	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
chance	1
of	1
much	1
learning	1
from	1
this	1
so	1
clever	1
lunatic	1
so	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
and	1
cheer	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
happy	1
words	1
with	1
that	1
sweet	1
soul	1
madam	1
mina	1
friend	1
john	1
it	1
does	1
rejoice	1
me	1
unspeakable	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
pained	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
worried	1
with	1
our	1
terrible	1
things	1
though	1
we	1
shall	1
much	1
miss	1
her	1
help	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
so	1
i	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
answered	1
earnestly	1
for	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
weaken	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
mrs	1
harker	1
is	1
better	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
things	1
are	1
quite	1
bad	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
many	1
tight	1
places	1
in	1
our	1
time	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
affair	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
time	1
infallibly	1
have	1
wrecked	1
her	1
so	1
van	1
helsing	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
confer	1
with	1
mrs	1
harker	1
and	1
harker	1
quincey	1
and	1
art	1
are	1
all	1
out	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
clues	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
earthboxes	1
i	1
shall	1
finish	1
my	1
round	1
of	1
work	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
tonight	1

1	1
october	1
it	1
is	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
today	1
after	1
jonathans	1
full	1
confidence	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
manifestly	1
avoid	1
certain	1
matters	1
and	1
those	1
the	1
most	1
vital	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
morning	1
i	1
slept	1
late	1
after	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
yesterday	1
and	1
though	1
jonathan	1
was	1
late	1
too	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
earlier	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
never	1
more	1
sweetly	1
or	1
tenderly	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
mentioned	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
counts	1
house	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
known	1
how	1
terribly	1
anxious	1
i	1
was	1
poor	1
dear	1
fellow	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
distressed	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
did	1
me	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
drawn	1
further	1
into	1
this	1
awful	1
work	1
and	1
i	1
acquiesced	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
keeps	1
anything	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
crying	1
like	1
a	1
silly	1
fool	1
when	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
comes	1
from	1
my	1
husbands	1
great	1
love	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
good	1
good	1
wishes	1
of	1
those	1
other	1
strong	1
men	1
that	1
has	1
done	1
me	1
good	1
well	1
some	1
day	1
jonathan	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
and	1
lest	1
it	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
think	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
i	1
kept	1
anything	1
from	1
him	1
i	1
still	1
keep	1
my	1
journal	1
as	1
usual	1
then	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
feared	1
of	1
my	1
trust	1
i	1
shall	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
every	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
put	1
down	1
for	1
his	1
dear	1
eyes	1
to	1
read	1
i	1
feel	1
strangely	1
sad	1
and	1
lowspirited	1
today	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
reaction	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
excitement	1
last	1
night	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
gone	1
simply	1
because	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
i	1
didnt	1
feel	1
sleepy	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
feel	1
full	1
of	1
devouring	1
anxiety	1
i	1
kept	1
thinking	1
over	1
everything	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
ever	1
since	1
jonathan	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
in	1
london	1
and	1
it	1
all	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
horrible	1
tragedy	1
with	1
fate	1
pressing	1
on	1
relentlessly	1
to	1
some	1
destined	1
end	1
everything	1
that	1
one	1
does	1
seems	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
right	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
bring	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
deplored	1
if	1
i	1
hadnt	1
gone	1
to	1
whitby	1
perhaps	1
poor	1
dear	1
lucy	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
now	1
she	1
hadnt	1
taken	1
to	1
visiting	1
the	1
churchyard	1
till	1
i	1
came	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
hadnt	1
come	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
daytime	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
wouldnt	1
have	1
walked	1
there	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
hadnt	1
gone	1
there	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
asleep	1
that	1
monster	1
couldnt	1
have	1
destroyed	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
oh	1
why	1
did	1
i	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
whitby	1
there	1
now	1
crying	1
again	1
i	1
wonder	1
what	1
has	1
come	1
over	1
me	1
today	1
i	1
must	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
jonathan	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
twice	1
in	1
one	1
morning	1
i	1
who	1
never	1
cried	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
account	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
caused	1
to	1
shed	1
a	1
tear	1
the	1
dear	1
fellow	1
would	1
fret	1
his	1
heart	1
out	1
i	1
shall	1
put	1
a	1
bold	1
face	1
on	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
feel	1
weepy	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
it	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lessons	1
that	1
we	1
poor	1
women	1
have	1
to	1
learn	1
i	1
cant	1
quite	1
remember	1
how	1
i	1
fell	1
asleep	1
last	1
night	1
i	1
remember	1
hearing	1
the	1
sudden	1
barking	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
queer	1
sounds	1
like	1
praying	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
tumultuous	1
scale	1
from	1
mr	1
renfields	1
room	1
which	1
is	1
somewhere	1
under	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
over	1
everything	1
silence	1
so	1
profound	1
that	1
it	1
startled	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
silent	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
thrown	1
by	1
the	1
moonlight	1
seeming	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
silent	1
mystery	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
stirring	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
grim	1
and	1
fixed	1
as	1
death	1
or	1
fate	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
thin	1
streak	1
of	1
white	1
mist	1
that	1
crept	1
with	1
almost	1
imperceptible	1
slowness	1
across	1
the	1
grass	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
sentience	1
and	1
a	1
vitality	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
digression	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
good	1
for	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
bed	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
lethargy	1
creeping	1
over	1
me	1
i	1
lay	1
a	1
while	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
sleep	1
so	1
i	1
got	1
out	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
again	1
the	1
mist	1
was	1
spreading	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
lying	1
thick	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
stealing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
windows	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
was	1
more	1
loud	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
could	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
recognise	1
in	1
his	1
tones	1
some	1
passionate	1
entreaty	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
struggle	1
and	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
attendants	1
were	1
dealing	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
i	1
crept	1
into	1
bed	1
and	1
pulled	1
the	1
clothes	1
over	1
my	1
head	1
putting	1
my	1
fingers	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
then	1
a	1
bit	1
sleepy	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
i	1
thought	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
for	1
except	1
dreams	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
anything	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
jonathan	1
woke	1
me	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
me	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
to	1
realise	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
jonathan	1
who	1
was	1
bending	1
over	1
me	1
my	1
dream	1
was	1
very	1
peculiar	1
and	1
was	1
almost	1
typical	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
waking	1
thoughts	1
become	1
merged	1
in	1
or	1
continued	1
in	1
dreams	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
asleep	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
jonathan	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
powerless	1
to	1
act	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
brain	1
were	1
weighted	1
so	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
proceed	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
pace	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
slept	1
uneasily	1
and	1
thought	1
then	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
heavy	1
and	1
dank	1
and	1
cold	1
i	1
put	1
back	1
the	1
clothes	1
from	1
my	1
face	1
and	1
found	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
dim	1
around	1
the	1
gaslight	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
left	1
lit	1
for	1
jonathan	1
but	1
turned	1
down	1
came	1
only	1
like	1
a	1
tiny	1
red	1
spark	1
through	1
the	1
fog	1
which	1
had	1
evidently	1
grown	1
thicker	1
and	1
poured	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
there	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
shut	1
the	1
window	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
bed	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
to	1
make	1
certain	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
but	1
some	1
leaden	1
lethargy	1
seemed	1
to	1
chain	1
my	1
limbs	1
and	1
even	1
my	1
will	1
i	1
lay	1
still	1
and	1
endured	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
i	1
closed	1
my	1
eyes	1
but	1
could	1
still	1
see	1
through	1
my	1
eyelids	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
what	1
tricks	1
our	1
dreams	1
play	1
us	1
and	1
how	1
conveniently	1
we	1
can	1
imagine	1
the	1
mist	1
grew	1
thicker	1
and	1
thicker	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
now	1
how	1
it	1
came	1
in	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
like	1
smoke	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
energy	1
of	1
boiling	1
water	1
pouring	1
in	1
not	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
joinings	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
it	1
got	1
thicker	1
and	1
thicker	1
till	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
became	1
concentrated	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
pillar	1
of	1
cloud	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
through	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
gas	1
shining	1
like	1
a	1
red	1
eye	1
things	1
began	1
to	1
whirl	1
through	1
my	1
brain	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
cloudy	1
column	1
was	1
now	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
the	1
scriptural	1
words	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
cloud	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night	1
was	1
it	1
indeed	1
some	1
such	1
spiritual	1
guidance	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
sleep	1
but	1
the	1
pillar	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
nightguiding	1
for	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
eye	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
got	1
a	1
new	1
fascination	1
for	1
me	1
till	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
the	1
fire	1
divided	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
shine	1
on	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
fog	1
like	1
two	1
red	1
eyes	1
such	1
as	1
lucy	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
in	1
her	1
momentary	1
mental	1
wandering	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
cliff	1
the	1
dying	1
sunlight	1
struck	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
st	1
marys	1
church	1
suddenly	1
the	1
horror	1
burst	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
that	1
jonathan	1
had	1
seen	1
those	1
awful	1
women	1
growing	1
into	1
reality	1
throught	1
the	1
whirling	1
mist	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
dream	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fainted	1
for	1
all	1
became	1
black	1
darkness	1
the	1
last	1
conscious	1
effort	1
which	1
imagination	1
made	1
was	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
a	1
livid	1
white	1
face	1
bending	1
over	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
careful	1
of	1
such	1
dreams	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
unseat	1

mr	1

asked	1
if	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
me	1
poor	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
very	1

and	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
away	1
he	1
kissed	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
bade	1
god	1
bless	1
me	1
some	1
way	1
it	1
affected	1
me	1
much	1
i	1
am	1
crying	1
when	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
weakness	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
careful	1
jonathan	1
would	1
be	1
miserable	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
out	1
until	1
dinnertime	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
came	1
in	1
tired	1
i	1
did	1
what	1
i	1
could	1
to	1
brighten	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
i	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
effort	1
did	1
me	1
good	1
for	1
i	1
forgot	1
how	1
tired	1
i	1
was	1
after	1
dinner	1
they	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
smoke	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
each	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
from	1
jonathans	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
important	1
to	1
communicate	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
sleepy	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
i	1
asked	1
dr	1
seward	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
opiate	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
well	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
he	1
very	1
kindly	1
made	1
me	1
up	1
a	1
sleeping	1
draught	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
me	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
me	1
no	1
harm	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
mild	1
i	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
and	1
am	1
waiting	1
for	1
sleep	1
which	1
still	1
keeps	1
aloof	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
wrong	1
for	1
as	1
sleep	1
begins	1
to	1
flirt	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
new	1
fear	1
comes	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
foolish	1
in	1
thus	1
depriving	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
waking	1
i	1
might	1
want	1
it	1

evening	1
i	1
found	1
thomas	1
snelling	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
bethnal	1
green	1
but	1
unhappily	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
remember	1
anything	1
the	1
very	1
prospect	1
of	1
beer	1
which	1
my	1
expected	1
coming	1
had	1
opened	1
to	1
him	1
had	1
proved	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
too	1
early	1
on	1
his	1
expected	1
debauch	1
i	1
learned	1
however	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
seemed	1
a	1
decent	1
poor	1
soul	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
assistant	1

smollet	1
who	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
mates	1
was	1
the	1
responsible	1
person	1
so	1
off	1
i	1
drove	1
to	1
walworth	1
and	1
found	1
mr	1
joseph	1
smollet	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
shirtsleeves	1
taking	1
a	1
late	1
tea	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
saucer	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
decent	1
intelligent	1
fellow	1
distinctly	1
a	1
good	1
reliable	1
type	1
of	1
workman	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
headpiece	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
remembered	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
wonderful	1
dogseared	1
notebook	1
which	1
he	1
produced	1
from	1
some	1
mysterious	1
receptable	1
about	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
his	1
trousers	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
hieroglyphical	1
entries	1
in	1
thick	1
halfobliterated	1

he	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
destinations	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
there	1
were	1
he	1
said	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
cartload	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
carfax	1

left	1
at	1

chicksand	1
street	1
mile	1
end	1
new	1
town	1
and	1
another	1
six	1
which	1
he	1
deposited	1
at	1
jamaica	1
lane	1
bermondsey	1
if	1
then	1
the	1
count	1
meant	1
to	1
scatter	1
these	1
ghastly	1
refuges	1
of	1
his	1
over	1
london	1
these	1
places	1
were	1
chosen	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
delivery	1
so	1
that	1
later	1
he	1
might	1
distribute	1
more	1
fully	1
the	1
systematic	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
confine	1
himself	1
to	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
london	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
northern	1
shore	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1

southern	1
shore	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
west	1
were	1
surely	1
never	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
diabolical	1
scheme	1
let	1
alone	1
the	1
city	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
fashionable	1
london	1
in	1
the	1
southwest	1
and	1
west	1
i	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
smollet	1

asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
us	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
boxes	1

a	1

tonight	1
and	1
want	1
sleep	1
mina	1
is	1
fast	1
asleep	1
and	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
pale	1
her	1
eyes	1
look	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
poor	1
dear	1
ive	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
frets	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
make	1
her	1
doubly	1
anxious	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
disappointed	1
and	1
worried	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
now	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
nerve	1
broken	1
the	1
doctors	1
were	1
quite	1
right	1
to	1
insist	1
on	1
her	1
being	1
kept	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
dreadful	1
business	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
firm	1
for	1
on	1
me	1
this	1
particular	1
burden	1
of	1
silence	1
must	1
rest	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
ever	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
with	1
her	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
indeed	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
hard	1
task	1
after	1
all	1
for	1
she	1
herself	1
has	1
become	1
reticent	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
his	1
doings	1
ever	1
since	1
we	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
our	1
decision	1

october	1

a	1
long	1
and	1
trying	1
and	1
exciting	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
post	1
i	1
got	1
my	1

envelope	1
with	1
a	1
dirty	1
scrap	1
of	1
paper	1
enclosed	1

rose	1
without	1

pale	1
and	1
far	1
from	1

i	1
determined	1

that	1
when	1

should	1

that	1
mr	1
bloxam	1
who	1
had	1
slept	1
off	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1

on	1
the	1
previous	1
night	1
at	1

left	1
for	1
his	1
work	1
at	1
poplar	1
at	1
five	1
oclock	1
that	1

not	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
work	1
was	1
situated	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vague	1
idea	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
newfangled	1
wareus	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
slender	1
clue	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
poplar	1
it	1
was	1
twelve	1
oclock	1
before	1
i	1
got	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
hint	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
building	1
and	1
this	1
i	1
got	1
at	1
a	1
coffeeshop	1
where	1
some	1
workmen	1
were	1
having	1
their	1
dinner	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
suggested	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
being	1
erected	1
at	1
cross	1
angel	1
street	1
a	1
new	1
cold	1
storage	1
building	1
and	1
as	1
this	1
suited	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
newfangled	1
wareus	1
i	1
at	1
once	1
drove	1
to	1
it	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
a	1
surly	1
gatekeeper	1
and	1
a	1
surlier	1
foreman	1
both	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
appeased	1
with	1
the	1
coin	1
of	1
the	1
realm	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
bloxam	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
on	1
my	1
suggesting	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
days	1
wages	1
to	1
his	1
foreman	1
for	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
asking	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
on	1
a	1
private	1
matter	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
smart	1
enough	1
fellow	1
though	1
rough	1
of	1
speech	1
and	1
bearing	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
his	1
information	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
an	1
earnest	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
two	1
journeys	1
between	1
carfax	1
and	1

hired	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1

asked	1
him	1
if	1

tell	1
me	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1

with	1

steps	1
till	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
away	1
cussin	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
with	1
this	1
description	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
having	1
paid	1
my	1
friend	1
for	1
his	1
information	1
i	1
started	1
off	1
for	1
piccadilly	1
i	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
new	1
painful	1
experience	1
the	1
count	1
could	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
handle	1
the	1
earthboxes	1
himself	1
if	1
so	1
time	1
was	1
precious	1
for	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
achieved	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
distribution	1
he	1
could	1
by	1
choosing	1
his	1
own	1
time	1
complete	1
the	1
task	1
unobserved	1
at	1
piccadilly	1
circus	1
i	1
discharged	1
my	1
cab	1
and	1
walked	1
westward	1
beyond	1
the	1
junior	1
constitutional	1
i	1
came	1
across	1
the	1
house	1
described	1
and	1
was	1
satisfied	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
next	1
of	1
the	1
lairs	1
arranged	1
by	1
dracula	1
the	1
house	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
untenanted	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
encrusted	1
with	1
dust	1
and	1
the	1
shutters	1
were	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
framework	1
was	1
black	1
with	1
time	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
iron	1
the	1
paint	1
had	1
mostly	1
scaled	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
up	1
to	1
lately	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
large	1
noticeboard	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
balcony	1
it	1
had	1
however	1
been	1
roughly	1
torn	1
away	1
the	1
uprights	1
which	1
had	1
supported	1
it	1
still	1
remaining	1
behind	1
the	1
rails	1
of	1
the	1
balcony	1
i	1
saw	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
loose	1
boards	1
whose	1
raw	1
edges	1
looked	1
white	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
noticeboard	1
intact	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
perhaps	1
have	1
given	1
some	1
clue	1
to	1
the	1
ownership	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
remembered	1
my	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
investigation	1
and	1
purchase	1
of	1
carfax	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
find	1
the	1
former	1
owner	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
means	1
discovered	1
of	1
gaining	1
access	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
present	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
piccadilly	1
side	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
so	1
i	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
anything	1
could	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
this	1
quarter	1
the	1
mews	1
were	1
active	1
the	1
piccadilly	1
houses	1
being	1
mostly	1
in	1
occupation	1
i	1
asked	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
grooms	1
and	1
helpers	1
whom	1
i	1
saw	1
around	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
empty	1
house	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
it	1
had	1
lately	1
been	1
taken	1
but	1
he	1
couldnt	1
say	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
however	1
that	1
up	1
to	1
very	1
lately	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
noticeboard	1
of	1
for	1
sale	1
up	1
and	1
that	1
perhaps	1
mitchell	1
sons	1
	1
candy	1
the	1
house	1
agents	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
something	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
remembered	1
seeing	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
firm	1
on	1
the	1
board	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
seem	1
too	1
eager	1
or	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
informant	1
know	1
or	1
guess	1
too	1
much	1
so	1
thanking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
manner	1
i	1
strolled	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
growing	1
dusk	1
and	1
the	1
autumn	1
night	1
was	1
closing	1
in	1
so	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
any	1
time	1
having	1
learned	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
mitchell	1
sons	1
	1
candy	1
from	1
a	1

soon	1
at	1
their	1
office	1
in	1
sackville	1
street	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
saw	1
me	1
was	1
particularly	1
suave	1
in	1
manner	1
but	1
uncommunicative	1
in	1
equal	1
proportion	1
having	1
once	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
piccadilly	1
house	1
which	1
throughout	1
our	1
interview	1
he	1
called	1
a	1
mansion	1
was	1
sold	1
he	1
considered	1
my	1
business	1
as	1
concluded	1
when	1
i	1
asked	1
who	1
had	1
purchased	1
it	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
a	1
thought	1
wider	1
and	1
paused	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
before	1
replying	1
it	1
is	1
sold	1
sir	1
pardon	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
with	1
equal	1
politeness	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
special	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
purchased	1
it	1
again	1
he	1
paused	1
longer	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
still	1
more	1
it	1
is	1

sir	1
was	1
again	1
his	1
laconic	1
reply	1
surely	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
letting	1
me	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
mind	1
he	1
answered	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
their	1
clients	1
are	1
absolutely	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1

there	1
was	1
no	1

thought	1
i	1
had	1
best	1
meet	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ground	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
your	1

happy	1
in	1
having	1
so	1
resolute	1
a	1

by	1
curiosity	1

act	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
lord	1

who	1
wishes	1
to	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
which	1
was	1
he	1
understood	1
lately	1
for	1

these	1
words	1
put	1
a	1
different	1
complexion	1
on	1
affairs	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
oblige	1
you	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
mr	1
harker	1
and	1
especially	1
would	1
i	1
like	1
to	1
oblige	1
his	1
lordship	1
we	1
once	1
carried	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
of	1
renting	1
some	1
chambers	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
honourable	1

if	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
his	1
lordships	1
address	1
i	1
will	1
consult	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
will	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
communicate	1
with	1
his	1
lordship	1
by	1
tonights	1
post	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
so	1
far	1
deviate	1
from	1
our	1
rules	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
required	1
information	1
to	1
his	1
lordship	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
enemy	1
so	1
i	1
thanked	1
him	1
gave	1
the	1
address	1
at	1
dr	1
sewards	1
and	1
came	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
dark	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
tired	1
and	1
hungry	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
at	1
the	1
aerated	1
bread	1
company	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
purfleet	1
by	1
the	1
next	1
train	1
i	1
found	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
at	1
home	1
mina	1
was	1
looking	1
tired	1
and	1
pale	1
but	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
gallant	1
effort	1
to	1
be	1
bright	1
and	1
cheerful	1
it	1
wrung	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
anything	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
so	1
caused	1
her	1
inquietude	1
thank	1
god	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
night	1
of	1
her	1
looking	1
on	1
at	1
our	1
conferences	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
sting	1
of	1
our	1
not	1
showing	1
our	1
confidence	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
my	1
courage	1
to	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
resolution	1
of	1
keeping	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
grim	1
task	1
she	1
seems	1
somehow	1
more	1
reconciled	1
or	1
else	1
the	1
very	1
subject	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
repugnant	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
when	1
any	1
accidental	1
allusion	1
is	1
made	1
she	1
actually	1
shudders	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
we	1
made	1
our	1
resolution	1
in	1
time	1
as	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
as	1
this	1
our	1
growing	1
knowledge	1
would	1
be	1
torture	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
the	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
discovery	1
till	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
so	1
after	1
dinner	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
music	1
to	1
save	1
appearances	1
even	1
amongst	1
ourselves	1
i	1
took	1
mina	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
the	1
dear	1
girl	1
was	1
more	1
affectionate	1
with	1
me	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
detain	1
me	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
of	1
and	1
i	1
came	1
away	1
thank	1
god	1
the	1
ceasing	1
of	1
telling	1
things	1
has	1
made	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
i	1
had	1
written	1
my	1
diary	1
so	1
far	1
and	1
simply	1
read	1
it	1
off	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
means	1
of	1
letting	1
them	1
get	1
abreast	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
information	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
days	1
work	1
friend	1
jonathan	1
doubtless	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
boxes	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
then	1
our	1
work	1
is	1
near	1
the	1
end	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
missing	1
we	1
must	1
search	1
until	1
we	1
find	1
them	1
then	1
shall	1
we	1
make	1
our	1
final	1
coup	1
and	1
hunt	1
the	1
wretch	1
to	1
his	1
real	1
death	1
we	1
all	1
sat	1
silent	1
awhile	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
mr	1
morris	1
spoke	1
say	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
that	1
house	1
we	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
answered	1
lord	1
godalming	1
quickly	1
but	1
art	1
this	1
is	1
different	1
we	1
broke	1
house	1
at	1
carfax	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
walled	1
park	1
to	1
protect	1
us	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
mighty	1
different	1
thing	1
to	1
commit	1
burglary	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
either	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
night	1
i	1
confess	1
i	1
dont	1
see	1
how	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
unless	1
that	1
agency	1
duck	1
can	1
find	1
us	1
a	1
key	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
perhaps	1
we	1
shall	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
his	1
letter	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
lord	1
godalmings	1
brows	1
contracted	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
byandby	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
said	1
turning	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
us	1
quinceys	1
head	1
is	1
level	1
this	1
burglary	1
business	1
is	1
getting	1
serious	1
we	1
got	1
off	1
once	1
all	1
right	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
a	1
rare	1
job	1
on	1
hand	1
unless	1
we	1
can	1
find	1
the	1
counts	1
key	1
basket	1
as	1
nothing	1
could	1
well	1
be	1
done	1
before	1
morning	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
advisable	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
lord	1
godalming	1
should	1
hear	1
from	1
mitchells	1
we	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
active	1
step	1
before	1
breakfast	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
we	1
sat	1
and	1
smoked	1
discussing	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
its	1
various	1
lights	1
and	1
bearings	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
bringing	1
this	1
diary	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sleepy	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
just	1
a	1
line	1
mina	1
sleeps	1
soundly	1
and	1
her	1
breathing	1
is	1
regular	1
her	1
forehead	1
is	1
puckered	1
up	1
into	1
little	1
wrinkles	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
thinks	1
even	1
in	1
her	1
sleep	1
she	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
pale	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
so	1
haggard	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
this	1
morning	1
tomorrow	1
will	1
i	1
hope	1
mend	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
herself	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
exeter	1
oh	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
sleepy	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
1	1
october	1
i	1
am	1
puzzled	1
afresh	1
about	1
renfield	1
his	1
moods	1
change	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
i	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
keep	1
touch	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
mean	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
wellbeing	1
they	1
form	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
interesting	1
study	1
this	1
morning	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
after	1
his	1
repulse	1
of	1
van	1
helsing	1
his	1
manner	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
commanding	1
destiny	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
commanding	1
destiny	1
subjectively	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
care	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
mere	1
earth	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
weaknesses	1
and	1
wants	1
of	1
us	1
poor	1
mortals	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
improve	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
learn	1
something	1
so	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
flies	1
these	1
times	1
he	1
smiled	1
on	1
me	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
superior	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
such	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
would	1
have	1
become	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
malvolio	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
the	1
fly	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
has	1
one	1
striking	1
feature	1
its	1
wings	1
are	1
typical	1
of	1
the	1
aerial	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
psychic	1
faculties	1
the	1
ancients	1
did	1
well	1
when	1
they	1
typified	1
the	1
soul	1
as	1
a	1
butterfly	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
push	1
his	1
analogy	1
to	1
its	1
utmost	1
logically	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
quickly	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
soul	1
you	1
are	1
after	1
now	1
is	1
it	1
his	1
madness	1
foiled	1
his	1
reason	1
and	1
a	1
puzzled	1
look	1
spread	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
decision	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
but	1
seldom	1
seen	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
oh	1
no	1
oh	1
no	1
i	1
want	1
no	1
souls	1
life	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
here	1
he	1
brightened	1
up	1
i	1
am	1
pretty	1
indifferent	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
present	1
life	1
is	1
all	1
right	1
i	1
have	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
a	1
new	1
patient	1
doctor	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
study	1
zoophagy	1
this	1
puzzled	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
so	1
i	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
then	1
you	1
command	1
life	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
god	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
smiled	1
with	1
an	1
ineffably	1
benign	1
superiority	1
oh	1
no	1
far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
arrogate	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
attributes	1
of	1
the	1
deity	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
even	1
concerned	1
in	1
his	1
especially	1
spiritual	1
doings	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
state	1
my	1
intellectual	1
position	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
concerns	1
things	1
purely	1
terrestrial	1
somewhat	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
which	1
enoch	1
occupied	1
spiritually	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
poser	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
recall	1
enochs	1
appositeness	1
so	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
a	1
simple	1
question	1
though	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
i	1
was	1
lowering	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
lunatic	1
and	1
why	1
with	1
enoch	1
because	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
god	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
analogy	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
so	1
i	1
harked	1
back	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
denied	1
so	1
you	1
dont	1
care	1
about	1
life	1
and	1
you	1
dont	1
want	1
souls	1
why	1
not	1
i	1
put	1
my	1
question	1
quickly	1
and	1
somewhat	1
sternly	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
disconcert	1
him	1
the	1
effort	1
succeeded	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
relapsed	1
into	1
his	1
old	1
servile	1
manner	1
bent	1
low	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
actually	1
fawned	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
he	1
replied	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
any	1
souls	1
indeed	1
indeed	1
i	1
dont	1
i	1
couldnt	1
use	1
them	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
couldnt	1
eat	1
them	1
or	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
cunning	1
look	1
spread	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
windsweep	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
doctor	1
as	1
to	1
life	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
after	1
all	1
when	1
youve	1
got	1
all	1
you	1
require	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
want	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
friends	1
good	1
friends	1
like	1
you	1
dr	1
seward	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
leer	1
of	1
inexpressible	1
cunning	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
lack	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
life	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
cloudiness	1
of	1
his	1
insanity	1
he	1
saw	1
some	1
antagonism	1
in	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
fell	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
refuge	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
a	1
dogged	1
silence	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
sulky	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
came	1
away	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
ordinarily	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
without	1
special	1
reason	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
interested	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
gladly	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
besides	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
help	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
harker	1
is	1
out	1
following	1
up	1
clues	1
and	1
so	1
are	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
quincey	1
van	1
helsing	1
sits	1
in	1
my	1
study	1
poring	1
over	1
the	1
record	1
prepared	1
by	1
the	1
harkers	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
by	1
accurate	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
details	1
he	1
will	1
light	1
upon	1
some	1
clue	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
disturbed	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
without	1
cause	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
patient	1
only	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
after	1
his	1
last	1
repulse	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
go	1
again	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
another	1
reason	1
renfield	1
might	1
not	1
speak	1
so	1
freely	1
before	1
a	1
third	1
person	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
alone	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
sitting	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
his	1
stool	1
a	1
pose	1
which	1
is	1
generally	1
indicative	1
of	1
some	1
mental	1
energy	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
what	1
about	1
souls	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
then	1
that	1
my	1
surmise	1
had	1
been	1
correct	1
unconscious	1
cerebration	1
was	1
doing	1
its	1
work	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
lunatic	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
matter	1
out	1
what	1
about	1
them	1
yourself	1
i	1
asked	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
looked	1
all	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
inspiration	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
any	1
souls	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
apologetic	1
way	1
the	1
matter	1
seemed	1
preying	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
cruel	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
kind	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
like	1
life	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
life	1
oh	1
yes	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
right	1
you	1
neednt	1
worry	1
about	1
that	1
but	1
i	1
asked	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
life	1
without	1
getting	1
the	1
soul	1
also	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
puzzle	1
him	1
so	1
i	1
followed	1
it	1
up	1
a	1
nice	1
time	1
youll	1
have	1
some	1
time	1
when	1
youre	1
flying	1
out	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
flies	1
and	1
spiders	1
and	1
birds	1
and	1
cats	1
buzzing	1
and	1
twittering	1
and	1
miauing	1
all	1
round	1
you	1
youve	1
got	1
their	1
lives	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
souls	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
affect	1
his	1
imagination	1
for	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
screwing	1
them	1
up	1
tightly	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
boy	1
does	1
when	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
being	1
soaped	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
pathetic	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
touched	1
me	1
it	1
also	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
lesson	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
before	1
me	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
only	1
a	1
child	1
though	1
the	1
features	1
were	1
worn	1
and	1
the	1
stubble	1
on	1
the	1
jaws	1
was	1
white	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
undergoing	1
some	1
process	1
of	1
mental	1
disturbance	1
and	1
knowing	1
how	1
his	1
past	1
moods	1
had	1
interpreted	1
things	1
seemingly	1
foreign	1
to	1
himself	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
was	1
to	1
restore	1
confidence	1
so	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
speaking	1
pretty	1
loud	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
hear	1
me	1
through	1
his	1
closed	1
ears	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
some	1
sugar	1
to	1
get	1
your	1
flies	1
round	1
again	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
he	1
replied	1
not	1
much	1
flies	1
are	1
poor	1
things	1
after	1
all	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
he	1
added	1
but	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
their	1
souls	1
buzzing	1
round	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
spiders	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
blow	1
spiders	1
whats	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
spiders	1
there	1
isnt	1
anything	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
or	1
he	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
as	1
though	1
reminded	1
of	1
a	1
forbidden	1
topic	1
so	1
so	1
i	1
thought	1
to	1
myself	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
he	1
has	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
drink	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
renfield	1
seemed	1
himself	1
aware	1
of	1
having	1
made	1
a	1
lapse	1
for	1
he	1
hurried	1
on	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
distract	1
my	1
attention	1
from	1
it	1
i	1
dont	1
take	1
any	1
stock	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
rats	1
and	1
mice	1
and	1
such	1
small	1
deer	1
as	1
shakespeare	1
has	1
it	1
chickenfeed	1
of	1
the	1
larder	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
im	1
past	1
all	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
nonsense	1
you	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
ask	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
eat	1
molecules	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
chopsticks	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
interest	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
lesser	1
carnivora	1
when	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
before	1
me	1
i	1
see	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
want	1
big	1
things	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
make	1
your	1
teeth	1
meet	1
in	1
how	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
breakfast	1
on	1
elephant	1
what	1
ridiculous	1
nonsense	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
too	1
wide	1
awake	1
so	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
press	1
him	1
hard	1
i	1
wonder	1
i	1
said	1
reflectively	1
what	1
an	1
elephants	1
soul	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
effect	1
i	1
desired	1
was	1
obtained	1
for	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
highhorse	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
child	1
again	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
an	1
elephants	1
soul	1
or	1
any	1
soul	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
sat	1
despondently	1
suddenly	1
he	1
jumped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
blazing	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
intense	1
cerebral	1
excitement	1
to	1
hell	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
souls	1
he	1
shouted	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
plague	1
me	1
about	1
souls	1
havent	1
i	1
got	1
enough	1
to	1
worry	1
and	1
pain	1
and	1
distract	1
me	1
already	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
souls	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
hostile	1
that	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
for	1
another	1
homicidal	1
fit	1
so	1
i	1
blew	1
my	1
whistle	1
the	1
instant	1
however	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
became	1
calm	1
and	1
said	1
apologetically	1
forgive	1
me	1
doctor	1
i	1
forgot	1
myself	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
need	1
any	1
help	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
worried	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
irritable	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
the	1
problem	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
face	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
working	1
out	1
you	1
would	1
pity	1
and	1
tolerate	1
and	1
pardon	1
me	1
pray	1
do	1
not	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
straitwaistcoat	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
i	1
cannot	1
think	1
freely	1
when	1
my	1
body	1
is	1
confined	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
selfcontrol	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
attendants	1
came	1
i	1
told	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
mind	1
and	1
they	1
withdrew	1
renfield	1
watched	1
them	1
go	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
considerable	1
dignity	1
and	1
sweetness	1
dr	1
seward	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
considerate	1
towards	1

am	1
very	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
mood	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
came	1
away	1
there	1
is	1
certainly	1
something	1
to	1
ponder	1
over	1
in	1
this	1
mans	1
state	1
several	1
points	1
seem	1
to	1
make	1
what	1
the	1

calls	1
a	1
story	1
if	1
one	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
them	1
in	1
proper	1
order	1
here	1
they	1
are	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
drinking	1

the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
burdened	1
with	1
the	1

anything	1
has	1
no	1
dread	1
of	1
wanting	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
despises	1
the	1
meaner	1
forms	1
of	1
life	1
altogether	1
though	1
he	1
dreads	1
being	1
haunted	1
by	1
their	1
souls	1
logically	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
point	1
one	1
way	1
he	1
has	1
assurance	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
acquire	1
some	1
higher	1
life	1
he	1
dreads	1
the	1
consequence	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
human	1
life	1
he	1
looks	1
to	1
and	1
the	1
assurance	1
merciful	1
god	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
new	1
scheme	1
of	1
terror	1
afoot	1
later	1
i	1
went	1
after	1
my	1
round	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
my	1
suspicion	1
he	1
grew	1
very	1
grave	1
and	1
after	1
thinking	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
renfield	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
lunatic	1
within	1
singing	1
gaily	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
now	1
seems	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
when	1
we	1
entered	1
we	1
saw	1
with	1
amazement	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
sugar	1
as	1
of	1
old	1
the	1
flies	1

with	1
the	1
autumn	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
buzz	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
previous	1
conversation	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
attend	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
singing	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
present	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
a	1

was	1
folding	1
it	1

a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1

last	1

told	1

to	1

note	1
of	1
any	1
sound	1
he	1
might	1
hear	1
from	1

gave	1
him	1
instructions	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
anything	1
strange	1
he	1
was	1
to	1

was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
result	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
great	1
hopes	1
that	1
his	1
clue	1
may	1
be	1
an	1
important	1
one	1
before	1
going	1
to	1

i	1
went	1
round	1

the	1

looked	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
observation	1

he	1
was	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
and	1
his	1

rose	1

fell	1
with	1
regular	1
respiration	1
this	1
morning	1
the	1
man	1
on	1
duty	1
reported	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
midnight	1
he	1
was	1
restless	1
and	1
kept	1
saying	1
his	1
prayers	1
somewhat	1
loudly	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
manner	1
so	1
suspicious	1
that	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
point	1
blank	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asleep	1
he	1
denied	1
sleep	1

admitted	1
to	1
having	1
dozed	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
it	1
is	1

may	1
be	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1

i	1
wonder	1
if	1
renfields	1
quiet	1
has	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
his	1
moods	1
have	1
so	1
followed	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
that	1
the	1
coming	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
may	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
subtle	1
way	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
some	1
hint	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
between	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
argument	1
with	1
him	1
today	1
and	1
his	1
resumption	1
of	1

it	1
might	1
afford	1
us	1
a	1
valuable	1

he	1
is	1
now	1
seemingly	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1

that	1
wild	1

to	1
come	1
from	1

the	1
attendant	1
came	1
bursting	1
into	1
my	1
room	1

told	1
me	1
that	1
renfield	1
had	1
somehow	1
met	1
with	1
some	1
accident	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
yell	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
found	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1

let	1
me	1
put	1
down	1
with	1
exactness	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
remember	1
it	1
since	1
last	1
i	1
made	1
an	1
entry	1
not	1
a	1
detail	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
recall	1
must	1
be	1
forgotten	1
in	1
all	1
calmness	1
i	1
must	1
proceed	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
renfields	1
room	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
side	1
in	1
a	1
glittering	1
pool	1
of	1
blood	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
it	1
became	1
at	1
once	1
apparent	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
some	1
terrible	1
injuries	1
there	1
seemed	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
unity	1
of	1
purpose	1
between	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
which	1
marks	1
even	1
lethargic	1
sanity	1
as	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
exposed	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
horribly	1
bruised	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
against	1
the	1
floor	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
wounds	1
that	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
blood	1
originated	1
the	1
attendant	1
who	1
was	1
kneeling	1
beside	1
the	1
body	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
we	1
turned	1
him	1
over	1
i	1
think	1
sir	1
his	1
back	1
is	1
broken	1
see	1
both	1
his	1
right	1
arm	1
and	1
leg	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
are	1
paralysed	1
how	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
could	1
have	1
happened	1
puzzled	1
the	1
attendant	1
beyond	1
measure	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
bewildered	1
and	1
his	1
brows	1
were	1
gathered	1
in	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
cant	1
understand	1
the	1
two	1
things	1
he	1
could	1
mark	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
that	1
by	1
beating	1
his	1
own	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
do	1
it	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
eversfield	1
asylum	1
before	1
anyone	1
could	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
broken	1
his	1
neck	1
by	1
falling	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
if	1
he	1
got	1
in	1
an	1
awkward	1
kink	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
cant	1
imagine	1
how	1
the	1
two	1
things	1
occurred	1
if	1
his	1
back	1
was	1
broke	1
he	1
couldnt	1
beat	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
if	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
like	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
fall	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
marks	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
kindly	1
come	1
here	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
want	1
him	1
without	1
an	1
instants	1
delay	1
the	1
man	1
ran	1
off	1
and	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
slippers	1
appeared	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
renfield	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
looked	1
keenly	1
at	1
him	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
think	1
he	1
recognised	1
my	1
thought	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
very	1
quietly	1
manifestly	1
for	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
attendant	1
ah	1
a	1
sad	1
accident	1
he	1
will	1
need	1
very	1
careful	1
watching	1
and	1
much	1
attention	1
i	1
shall	1
stay	1
with	1
you	1
myself	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1
first	1
dress	1
myself	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
remain	1
i	1
shall	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
join	1
you	1
the	1
patient	1
was	1
now	1
breathing	1
stertorously	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
some	1
terrible	1
injury	1
van	1
helsing	1
returned	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
celerity	1
bearing	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
surgical	1
case	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
mind	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
almost	1
before	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
patient	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
me	1
send	1
the	1
attendant	1
away	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
becomes	1
conscious	1
after	1
the	1
operation	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
now	1
simmons	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
at	1
present	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
your	1
round	1
and	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
will	1
operate	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
instantly	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
anything	1
unusual	1
anywhere	1
the	1
man	1
withdrew	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
strict	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
were	1
superficial	1
the	1
real	1
injury	1
was	1
a	1
depressed	1
fracture	1
of	1
the	1
skull	1
extending	1
right	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
motor	1
area	1
the	1
professor	1
thought	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
said	1
we	1
must	1
reduce	1
the	1
pressure	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
normal	1
conditions	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
the	1
suffusion	1
shows	1
the	1
terrible	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
injury	1
the	1
whole	1
motor	1
area	1
seems	1
affected	1
the	1
suffusion	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
will	1
increase	1
quickly	1
so	1
we	1
must	1
trephine	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
soft	1
tapping	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
went	1
over	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
and	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
without	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
in	1
pajamas	1
and	1
slippers	1
the	1
former	1
spoke	1
i	1
heard	1
your	1
man	1
call	1
up	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
an	1
accident	1
so	1
i	1
woke	1
quincey	1
or	1
rather	1
called	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
things	1
are	1
moving	1
too	1
quickly	1
and	1
too	1
strangely	1
for	1
sound	1
sleep	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
these	1
times	1
ive	1
been	1
thinking	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
night	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
have	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
and	1
forward	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
may	1
we	1
come	1
in	1
i	1
nodded	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
then	1
i	1
closed	1
it	1
again	1
when	1
quincey	1
saw	1
the	1
attitude	1
and	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
and	1
noted	1
the	1
horrible	1
pool	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
he	1
said	1
softly	1
my	1
god	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
poor	1
poor	1
devil	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
briefly	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
we	1
expected	1
he	1
would	1
recover	1
consciousness	1
after	1
the	1
operation	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
he	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
with	1
godalming	1
beside	1
him	1
we	1
all	1
watched	1
in	1
patience	1
we	1
shall	1
wait	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
just	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
best	1
spot	1
for	1
trephining	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
most	1
quickly	1
and	1
perfectly	1
remove	1
the	1
blood	1
clot	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
haemorrhage	1
is	1
increasing	1
the	1
minutes	1
during	1
which	1
we	1
waited	1
passed	1
with	1
fearful	1
slowness	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
horrible	1
sinking	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
from	1
van	1
helsings	1
face	1
i	1
gathered	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
some	1
fear	1
or	1
apprehension	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
i	1
dreaded	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
renfield	1
might	1
speak	1
i	1
was	1
positively	1
afraid	1
to	1
think	1
but	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
coming	1
was	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
deathwatch	1
the	1
poor	1
mans	1
breathing	1
came	1
in	1
uncertain	1
gasps	1
each	1
instant	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
open	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
speak	1
but	1
then	1
would	1
follow	1
a	1
prolonged	1
stertorous	1
breath	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
relapse	1
into	1
a	1
more	1
fixed	1
insensibility	1
inured	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
sick	1
beds	1
and	1
death	1
this	1
suspense	1
grew	1
and	1
grew	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
almost	1
hear	1
the	1
beating	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
surging	1
through	1
my	1
temples	1
sounded	1
like	1
blows	1
from	1
a	1
hammer	1
the	1
silence	1
finally	1
became	1
agonising	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
companions	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
saw	1
from	1
their	1
flushed	1
faces	1
and	1
damp	1
brows	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
enduring	1
equal	1
torture	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nervous	1
suspense	1
over	1
us	1
all	1
as	1
though	1
overhead	1
some	1
dread	1
bell	1
would	1
peal	1
out	1
powerfully	1
when	1
we	1
should	1
least	1
expect	1
it	1
at	1
last	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
patient	1
was	1
sinking	1
fast	1
he	1
might	1
die	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
i	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
caught	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
mine	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
sternly	1
set	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
words	1
may	1
be	1
worth	1
many	1
lives	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
so	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
here	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
soul	1
at	1
stake	1
we	1
shall	1
operate	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
ear	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
operation	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
breathing	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
stertorous	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
breath	1
so	1
prolonged	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
tear	1
open	1
his	1
chest	1
suddenly	1
his	1
eyes	1
opened	1
and	1
became	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
wild	1
helpless	1
stare	1
this	1
was	1
continued	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
then	1
it	1
softened	1
into	1
a	1
glad	1
surprise	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
lips	1
came	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
he	1
moved	1
convulsively	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
said	1
ill	1
be	1
quiet	1
doctor	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
straitwaistcoat	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
terrible	1
dream	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
left	1
me	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
move	1
whats	1
wrong	1
with	1
my	1
face	1
it	1
feels	1
all	1
swollen	1
and	1
it	1
smarts	1
dreadfully	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
head	1
but	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
effort	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
glassy	1
again	1
so	1
i	1
gently	1
put	1
it	1
back	1
then	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
grave	1
tone	1
tell	1
us	1
your	1
dream	1
mr	1
renfield	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
his	1
face	1
brightened	1
through	1
its	1
mutilation	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
is	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
water	1
my	1
lips	1
are	1
dry	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
i	1
dreamed	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
seemed	1
fainting	1
i	1
called	1
quietly	1
to	1
quincey	1
the	1
brandy	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
study	1
quick	1
he	1
flew	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
the	1
decanter	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
a	1
carafe	1
of	1
water	1
we	1
moistened	1
the	1
parched	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
patient	1
quickly	1
revived	1
it	1
seemed	1
however	1
that	1
his	1
poor	1
injured	1
brain	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
conscious	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
piercingly	1
with	1
an	1
agonised	1
confusion	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
deceive	1
myself	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
dream	1
but	1
all	1
a	1
grim	1
reality	1
then	1
his	1
eyes	1
roved	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
they	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
figures	1
sitting	1
patiently	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
not	1
sure	1
already	1
i	1
would	1
know	1
from	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
not	1
with	1
pain	1
or	1
sleep	1
but	1
voluntarily	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
bringing	1
all	1
his	1
faculties	1
to	1
bear	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
energy	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
displayed	1
quick	1
doctor	1
quick	1
i	1
am	1
dying	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
death	1
or	1
worse	1
wet	1
my	1
lips	1
with	1
brandy	1
again	1
i	1
have	1
something	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
say	1
before	1
i	1
die	1
or	1
before	1
my	1
poor	1
crushed	1
brain	1
dies	1
anyhow	1
thank	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
night	1
after	1
you	1
left	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
implored	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
away	1
i	1
couldnt	1
speak	1
then	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
tongue	1
was	1
tied	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
as	1
sane	1
then	1
except	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
despair	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
after	1
you	1
left	1
me	1
it	1
seemed	1
hours	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sudden	1
peace	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
brain	1
seemed	1
to	1
become	1
cool	1
again	1
and	1
i	1
realised	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
dogs	1
bark	1
behind	1
our	1
house	1
but	1
not	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
van	1
helsings	1
eyes	1
never	1
blinked	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
met	1
mine	1
and	1
gripped	1
it	1
hard	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
however	1
betray	1
himself	1
he	1
nodded	1
slightly	1
and	1
said	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
renfield	1
proceeded	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
often	1
before	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
solid	1
then	1
not	1
a	1
ghost	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
fierce	1
like	1
a	1
mans	1
when	1
angry	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
mouth	1
the	1
sharp	1
white	1
teeth	1
glinted	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
belt	1
of	1
trees	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
dogs	1
were	1
barking	1
i	1
wouldnt	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
at	1
first	1
though	1
i	1
knew	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
all	1
along	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
promising	1
me	1
things	1
not	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
by	1
doing	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
professor	1
how	1
by	1
making	1
them	1
happen	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
send	1
in	1
the	1
flies	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
great	1
big	1
fat	1
ones	1
with	1
steel	1
and	1
sapphire	1
on	1
their	1
wings	1
and	1
big	1
moths	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
skull	1
and	1
crossbones	1
on	1
their	1
backs	1
van	1
helsing	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
me	1
unconsciously	1
the	1
acherontia	1
aiettropos	1
of	1
the	1
sphinges	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
the	1
deathshead	1
moth	1
the	1
patient	1
went	1
on	1
without	1
stopping	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
rats	1
rats	1
rats	1
hundreds	1
thousands	1
millions	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
life	1
and	1
dogs	1
to	1
eat	1
them	1
and	1
cats	1
too	1
all	1
lives	1
all	1
red	1
blood	1
with	1
years	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
buzzing	1
flies	1
i	1
laughed	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
then	1
the	1
dogs	1
howled	1
away	1
beyond	1
the	1
dark	1
trees	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
he	1
beckoned	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
without	1
using	1
any	1
words	1
a	1
dark	1
mass	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
grass	1
coming	1
on	1
like	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
moved	1
the	1
mist	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
thousands	1
of	1
rats	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
blazing	1
red	1
like	1
his	1
only	1
smaller	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
stopped	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
all	1
these	1
lives	1
will	1
i	1
give	1
you	1
ay	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
and	1
greater	1
through	1
countless	1
ages	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
red	1
cloud	1
like	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
blood	1
seemed	1
to	1
close	1
over	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
before	1
i	1
knew	1
what	1
i	1
was	1
doing	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
opening	1
the	1
sash	1
and	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
come	1
in	1
lord	1
and	1
master	1
the	1
rats	1
were	1
all	1
gone	1
but	1
he	1
slid	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
through	1
the	1
sash	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
open	1
an	1
inch	1
wide	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
herself	1
has	1
often	1
come	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
tiniest	1
crack	1
and	1
has	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
size	1
and	1
splendour	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
weaker	1
so	1
i	1
moistened	1
his	1
lips	1
with	1
the	1
brandy	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
memory	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
for	1
his	1
story	1
was	1
further	1
advanced	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
but	1
van	1
helsing	1
whispered	1
to	1
me	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
do	1
not	1
interrupt	1
him	1
he	1
cannot	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
maybe	1
could	1
not	1
proceed	1
at	1
all	1
if	1
once	1
he	1
lost	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
thought	1
he	1
proceeded	1
all	1
day	1
i	1
waited	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
me	1
anything	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
blowfly	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
moon	1
got	1
up	1
i	1
was	1
pretty	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
slid	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
knock	1
i	1
got	1
mad	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
sneered	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
his	1
white	1
face	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
eyes	1
gleaming	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
owned	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
didnt	1
even	1
smell	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
by	1
me	1
i	1
couldnt	1
hold	1
him	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
somehow	1
mrs	1
harker	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
standing	1
behind	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
but	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
better	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
silent	1
but	1
the	1
professor	1
started	1
and	1
quivered	1
his	1
face	1
however	1
grew	1
grimmer	1
and	1
sterner	1
still	1
renfield	1
went	1
on	1
without	1
noticing	1
when	1
mrs	1
harker	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
this	1
afternoon	1
she	1
wasnt	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
tea	1
after	1
the	1
teapot	1
had	1
been	1
watered	1
here	1
we	1
all	1
moved	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
didnt	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
till	1
she	1
spoke	1
and	1
she	1
didnt	1
look	1
the	1
same	1
i	1
dont	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
pale	1
people	1
i	1
like	1
them	1
with	1
lots	1
of	1
blood	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
hers	1
had	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
run	1
out	1
i	1
didnt	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
mad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taking	1
the	1
life	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
rest	1
quivered	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
but	1
we	1
remained	1
otherwise	1
still	1
so	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
tonight	1
i	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
mist	1
stealing	1
in	1
and	1
i	1
grabbed	1
it	1
tight	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
madmen	1
have	1
unnatural	1
strength	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
knew	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
madman	1
at	1
times	1
anyhow	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
power	1
ay	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
too	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
held	1
tight	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
win	1
for	1
i	1
didnt	1
mean	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
till	1
i	1
saw	1
his	1
eyes	1
they	1
burned	1
into	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
strength	1
became	1
like	1
water	1
he	1
slipped	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
cling	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
raised	1
me	1
up	1
and	1
flung	1
me	1
down	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
red	1
cloud	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
mist	1
seemed	1
to	1
steal	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
becoming	1
fainter	1
and	1
his	1
breath	1
more	1
stertorous	1
van	1
helsing	1
stood	1
up	1
instinctively	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
worst	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
his	1
purpose	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
armed	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
night	1
but	1
lose	1
no	1
time	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
spare	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
put	1
our	1
fear	1
nay	1
our	1
conviction	1
into	1
words	1
we	1
shared	1
them	1
in	1
common	1
we	1
all	1
hurried	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
our	1
rooms	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
when	1
we	1
entered	1
the	1
courts	1
house	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
his	1
ready	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
them	1
significantly	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
never	1
leave	1
me	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
till	1
this	1
unhappy	1
business	1
is	1
over	1
be	1
wise	1
also	1
my	1
friends	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
common	1
enemy	1
that	1
we	1
deal	1
with	1
alas	1
alas	1
that	1
that	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
should	1
suffer	1
he	1
stopped	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
breaking	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
rage	1
or	1
terror	1
predominated	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
outside	1
the	1
harkers	1
door	1
we	1
paused	1
art	1
and	1
quincey	1
held	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
said	1
should	1
we	1
disturb	1
her	1
we	1
must	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
grimly	1
if	1
the	1
door	1
be	1
locked	1
i	1
shall	1
break	1
it	1
in	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
frighten	1
her	1
terribly	1
it	1
is	1
unusual	1
to	1
break	1
into	1
a	1
ladys	1
room	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
solemnly	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
right	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
all	1
chambers	1
are	1
alike	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
even	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
one	1
to	1
me	1
tonight	1
friend	1
john	1
when	1
i	1
turn	1
the	1
handle	1
if	1
the	1
door	1
does	1
not	1
open	1
do	1
you	1
put	1
your	1
shoulder	1
down	1
and	1
shove	1
and	1
you	1
too	1
my	1
friends	1
now	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
handle	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
did	1
not	1
yield	1
we	1
threw	1
ourselves	1
against	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
it	1
burst	1
open	1
and	1
we	1
almost	1
fell	1
headlong	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
professor	1
did	1
actually	1
fall	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
across	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
gathered	1
himself	1
up	1
from	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
what	1
i	1
saw	1
appalled	1
me	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
hair	1
rise	1
like	1
bristles	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
still	1
the	1
moonlight	1
was	1
so	1
bright	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
thick	1
yellow	1
blind	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
beside	1
the	1
window	1
lay	1
jonathan	1
harker	1
his	1
face	1
flushed	1
and	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
stupor	1
kneeling	1
on	1
the	1
near	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
facing	1
outwards	1
was	1
the	1
whiteclad	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
stood	1
a	1
tall	1
thin	1
man	1
clad	1
in	1
black	1
his	1
face	1

turned	1
from	1
us	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
we	1
saw	1
we	1
all	1
recognised	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
scar	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
both	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
hands	1
keeping	1
them	1
away	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
at	1
full	1
tension	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
gripped	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
forcing	1
her	1
face	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
bosom	1
her	1
white	1
nightdress	1
was	1
smeared	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
a	1
thin	1
stream	1
trickled	1
down	1
the	1
mans	1
bare	1
breast	1
which	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
his	1
tornopen	1
dress	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
a	1
terrible	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
forcing	1
a	1
kittens	1
nose	1
into	1
a	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
to	1
compel	1
it	1
to	1
drink	1
as	1
we	1
burst	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
count	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
hellish	1
look	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
described	1
seemed	1
to	1
leap	1
into	1
it	1
his	1
eyes	1
flamed	1
red	1
with	1
devilish	1
passion	1
the	1
great	1
nostrils	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
aquiline	1
nose	1
opened	1
wide	1
and	1
quivered	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
behind	1
the	1
full	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
blooddripping	1
mouth	1
champed	1
together	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
with	1
a	1
wrench	1
which	1
threw	1
his	1
victim	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
as	1
though	1
hurled	1
from	1
a	1
height	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
sprang	1
at	1
us	1
but	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
was	1
holding	1
towards	1
him	1
the	1
envelope	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
sacred	1
wafer	1
the	1
count	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
just	1
as	1
poor	1
lucy	1
had	1
done	1
outside	1
the	1
tomb	1
and	1
cowered	1
back	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
back	1
he	1
cowered	1
as	1
we	1
lifting	1
our	1
crucifixes	1
advanced	1
the	1
moonlight	1
suddenly	1
failed	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
black	1
cloud	1
sailed	1
across	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
gaslight	1
sprang	1
up	1
under	1
quinceys	1
match	1
we	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
faint	1
vapour	1
this	1
as	1
we	1
looked	1
trailed	1
under	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
with	1
the	1
recoil	1
from	1
its	1
bursting	1
open	1
had	1
swung	1
back	1
to	1
its	1
old	1
position	1
van	1
helsing	1
art	1
and	1
i	1
moved	1
forward	1
to	1
mrs	1
harker	1
who	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
had	1
drawn	1
her	1
breath	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
scream	1
so	1
wild	1
so	1
earpiercing	1
so	1
despairing	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
ring	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
till	1
my	1
dying	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
she	1
lay	1
in	1
her	1
helpless	1
attitude	1
and	1
disarray	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
ghastly	1
with	1
a	1
pallor	1
which	1
was	1
accentuated	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
smeared	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
cheeks	1
and	1
chin	1
from	1
her	1
throat	1
trickled	1
a	1
thin	1
stream	1
of	1
blood	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
mad	1
with	1
terror	1
then	1
she	1
put	1
before	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
poor	1
crushed	1
hands	1
which	1
bore	1
on	1
their	1
whiteness	1
the	1
red	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
terrible	1
grip	1
and	1
from	1
behind	1
them	1
came	1
a	1
low	1
desolate	1
wail	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
terrible	1
scream	1
seem	1
only	1
the	1
quick	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
endless	1
grief	1
van	1
helsing	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
coverlet	1
gently	1
over	1
her	1
body	1
whilst	1
art	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
an	1

despairingly	1
ran	1
out	1

as	1
we	1

a	1
few	1
moments	1
till	1

herself	1
i	1

wake	1

he	1
dipped	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
towel	1
in	1
cold	1
water	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
flick	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
holding	1
her	1
face	1
between	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
sobbing	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
was	1
heartbreaking	1
to	1
hear	1
i	1
raised	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
moonshine	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
quincey	1
morris	1
run	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
yew	1
tree	1
it	1
puzzled	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
i	1
heard	1
harkers	1
quick	1
exclamation	1
as	1
he	1
woke	1
to	1
partial	1
consciousness	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
there	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
wild	1
amazement	1
he	1
seemed	1
dazed	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
and	1
then	1
full	1
consciousness	1
seemed	1
to	1
burst	1
upon	1
him	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
he	1
started	1
up	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
quick	1
movement	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
stretched	1
out	1
as	1
though	1
to	1

him	1
instantly	1
however	1
she	1
drew	1
them	1
in	1
again	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
elbows	1
together	1
held	1
her	1

up	1

stained	1
with	1

where	1

where	1
the	1

sent	1
forth	1

this	1
he	1
spoke	1
out	1
resolutely	1
nonsense	1
mina	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
to	1
me	1
to	1

a	1
word	1
i	1
would	1
not	1

judge	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
deserts	1
and	1
punish	1
me	1
with	1
more	1
bitter	1
suffering	1
than	1

act	1
or	1
will	1
of	1

anything	1
ever	1
come	1
between	1

he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
folded	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
she	1
lay	1
there	1
sobbing	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
us	1
over	1
her	1
bowed	1
head	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
blinked	1
damply	1
above	1
his	1
quivering	1
nostrils	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
set	1
as	1
steel	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
her	1
sobs	1
became	1
less	1
frequent	1
and	1
more	1
faint	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
studied	1
calmness	1
which	1
i	1
felt	1
tried	1
his	1
nervous	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and	1
now	1
dr	1
seward	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1

too	1
well	1

broad	1
fact	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
with	1
seeming	1
impassiveness	1
but	1
his	1
nostrils	1
twitched	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
blazed	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
how	1
the	1
ruthless	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
held	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
that	1
terrible	1
and	1
horrid	1
position	1
with	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
wound	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
it	1
interested	1
me	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
whilst	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
white	1
set	1
passion	1
worked	1
convulsively	1
over	1
the	1
bowed	1
head	1
the	1
hands	1
tenderly	1
and	1
lovingly	1
stroked	1
the	1
ruffled	1
hair	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
quincey	1
and	1

knocked	1
at	1

entered	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
our	1
summons	1

looked	1
at	1
me	1
questioningly	1
i	1
understood	1
him	1
to	1
mean	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
their	1
coming	1
to	1
divert	1
if	1
possible	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
unhappy	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
from	1
themselves	1
so	1
on	1
nodding	1
acquiescence	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
asked	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
or	1
done	1
to	1
which	1
lord	1
godalming	1
answered	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
rooms	1
i	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
he	1
had	1
however	1
he	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
poor	1
drooping	1
figure	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
gravely	1
go	1
on	1
friend	1
arthur	1
we	1
want	1
here	1
no	1
more	1
concealments	1
our	1
hope	1
now	1
is	1
in	1
knowing	1
all	1
tell	1
freely	1
so	1
art	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
made	1
rare	1
hay	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
all	1
the	1
manuscript	1
had	1
been	1
burned	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
flames	1
were	1
flickering	1
amongst	1
the	1
white	1
ashes	1
the	1
cylinders	1
of	1
your	1
phonograph	1
too	1
were	1
thrown	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
wax	1
had	1
helped	1
the	1
flames	1
here	1
i	1
interrupted	1
thank	1
god	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
other	1
copy	1
in	1
the	1
safe	1
his	1
face	1
lit	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
fell	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
ran	1
down	1
stairs	1
then	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
looked	1
into	1
renfields	1
room	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
there	1
except	1
again	1
he	1
paused	1
go	1
on	1
said	1
harker	1
hoarsely	1
so	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
moistening	1
his	1
lips	1
with	1
his	1
tongue	1
added	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
is	1
dead	1
mrs	1
harker	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
looking	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us	1
she	1
said	1
solemnly	1
gods	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
that	1
art	1
was	1
keeping	1
back	1
something	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
purpose	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
van	1
helsing	1
turned	1
to	1
morris	1
and	1
asked	1
and	1
you	1
friend	1
quincey	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
answered	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
much	1
eventually	1
but	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
cant	1
say	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
possible	1
where	1
the	1
count	1
would	1
go	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
bat	1
rise	1
from	1
renfields	1
window	1
and	1
flap	1
westward	1
i	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
shape	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
carfax	1
but	1
he	1
evidently	1
sought	1
some	1
other	1
lair	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
back	1
tonight	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
reddening	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
dawn	1
is	1
close	1
we	1
must	1
work	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
latter	1
words	1
through	1
his	1
shut	1
teeth	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
perhaps	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
minutes	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
fancy	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
our	1
hearts	1
beating	1
then	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
placing	1
his	1
hand	1
very	1
tenderly	1
on	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
head	1
and	1
now	1
madam	1
mina	1
poor	1
dear	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
tell	1
us	1
exactly	1
what	1
happened	1
god	1
knows	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
that	1
you	1
be	1
pained	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
need	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
all	1
for	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
has	1
all	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
quick	1
and	1
sharp	1
and	1
in	1
deadly	1
earnest	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
close	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
must	1
end	1
all	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
chance	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live	1
and	1
learn	1
the	1
poor	1
dear	1
lady	1
shivered	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
tension	1
of	1
her	1
nerves	1
as	1
she	1
clasped	1
her	1
husband	1
closer	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
still	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
then	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
proudly	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
who	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
after	1
stooping	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
reverently	1
held	1
it	1
fast	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
was	1
locked	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
who	1
held	1
his	1
other	1
arm	1
thrown	1
round	1
her	1
protectingly	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
evidently	1
ordering	1
her	1
thoughts	1
she	1
began	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
sleeping	1
draught	1
which	1
you	1
had	1
so	1
kindly	1
given	1
me	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
act	1
i	1
seemed	1
to	1
become	1
more	1
wakeful	1
and	1
myriads	1
of	1
horrible	1
fancies	1
began	1
to	1
crowd	1
in	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
connected	1
with	1
death	1
and	1
vampires	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
pain	1
and	1
trouble	1
her	1
husband	1
involuntarily	1
groaned	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
lovingly	1
do	1
not	1
fret	1
dear	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
brave	1
and	1
strong	1
and	1
help	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
horrible	1
task	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
an	1
effort	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
this	1
fearful	1
thing	1
at	1
all	1
you	1
would	1
understand	1
how	1
much	1
i	1
need	1
your	1
help	1
well	1
i	1
saw	1
i	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
medicine	1
to	1
its	1
work	1
with	1
my	1
will	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
any	1
good	1
so	1
i	1
resolutely	1
set	1
myself	1
to	1
sleep	1
sure	1
enough	1
sleep	1
must	1
soon	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
remember	1
no	1
more	1
jonathan	1
coming	1
in	1
had	1
not	1
waked	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
lay	1
by	1
my	1
side	1
when	1
next	1
i	1
remember	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
same	1
thin	1
white	1
mist	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
noticed	1
but	1
i	1
forget	1
now	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
this	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
diary	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
show	1
you	1
later	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
vague	1
terror	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
of	1
some	1
presence	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
wake	1
jonathan	1
but	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
slept	1
so	1
soundly	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
sleeping	1
draught	1
and	1
not	1
i	1
i	1
tried	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
wake	1
him	1
this	1
caused	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
fear	1
and	1
i	1
looked	1
around	1
terrified	1
then	1
indeed	1
my	1
heart	1
sank	1
within	1
me	1
beside	1
the	1
bed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist	1
or	1
rather	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
mist	1
had	1
turned	1
into	1
his	1
figure	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
entirely	1
disappeared	1
stood	1
a	1
tall	1
thin	1
man	1
all	1
in	1
black	1
i	1
knew	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
waxen	1
face	1
the	1
high	1
aquiline	1
nose	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
fell	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
white	1
line	1
the	1
parted	1
red	1
lips	1
with	1
the	1
sharp	1
white	1
teeth	1
showing	1
between	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
eyes	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
sunset	1
on	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
st	1
marys	1
church	1
at	1
whitby	1
i	1
knew	1
too	1
the	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
where	1
jonathan	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
my	1
heart	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
screamed	1
out	1
only	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
paralysed	1
in	1
the	1
pause	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
keen	1
cutting	1
whisper	1
pointing	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
jonathan	1
silence	1
if	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
sound	1
i	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
dash	1
his	1
brains	1
out	1
before	1
your	1
very	1
eyes	1
i	1
was	1
appalled	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
bewildered	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
say	1
anything	1
with	1
a	1
mocking	1
smile	1
he	1
placed	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
holding	1
me	1
tight	1
bared	1
my	1
throat	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
first	1
a	1
little	1
refreshment	1
to	1
reward	1
my	1
exertions	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
quiet	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
or	1
the	1
second	1
that	1
your	1
veins	1
have	1
appeased	1
my	1
thirst	1
i	1
was	1
bewildered	1
and	1
strangely	1
enough	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hinder	1
him	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
curse	1
that	1
such	1
is	1
when	1
his	1
touch	1
is	1
on	1
his	1
victim	1
and	1
oh	1
my	1
god	1
my	1
god	1
pity	1
me	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
reeking	1
lips	1
upon	1
my	1
throat	1
her	1
husband	1
groaned	1
again	1
she	1
clasped	1
his	1
hand	1
harder	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
pityingly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
injured	1
one	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
strength	1
fading	1
away	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
swoon	1
how	1
long	1
this	1
horrible	1
thing	1
lasted	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
must	1
have	1
passed	1
before	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
foul	1
awful	1
sneering	1
mouth	1
away	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
drip	1
with	1
the	1
fresh	1
blood	1
the	1
remembrance	1
seemed	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
to	1
overpower	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
drooped	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
sunk	1
down	1
but	1
for	1
her	1
husbands	1
sustaining	1
arm	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
she	1
recovered	1
herself	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
then	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
mockingly	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
would	1
play	1
your	1
brains	1
against	1
mine	1
you	1
would	1
help	1
these	1
men	1
to	1
hunt	1
me	1
and	1
frustrate	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
designs	1
you	1
know	1
now	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
in	1
part	1
already	1
and	1
will	1
know	1
in	1
full	1
before	1
long	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
cross	1
my	1
path	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
kept	1
their	1
energies	1
for	1

when	1
dr	1

dr	1
seward	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
seeing	1
poor	1
renfield	1
we	1
went	1
gravely	1
into	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
first	1
dr	1
seward	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
and	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
below	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
renfield	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
all	1
bruised	1
and	1
crushed	1
in	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
were	1
broken	1
dr	1
seward	1
asked	1
the	1
attendant	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
anything	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
down	1
he	1
confessed	1
to	1
half	1
dozing	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
loud	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
then	1
renfield	1
had	1
called	1
out	1
loudly	1
several	1
times	1
god	1
god	1
god	1
after	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
falling	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
face	1
down	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
doctors	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
van	1
helsing	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
voices	1
or	1
a	1
voice	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
one	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
to	1
it	1
if	1
required	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
god	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
patient	1
dr	1
seward	1
said	1
to	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
alone	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
an	1
inquest	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
put	1
forward	1
the	1
truth	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
believe	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
attendants	1
evidence	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
a	1
certificate	1
of	1
death	1
by	1
misadventure	1
in	1
falling	1
from	1
bed	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
coroner	1
should	1
demand	1
it	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
formal	1
inquest	1
necessarily	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
result	1
when	1
the	1
question	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
discussed	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
our	1
next	1
step	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
thing	1
we	1
decided	1
was	1
that	1
mina	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
full	1
confidence	1
that	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
painful	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
her	1
she	1
herself	1
agreed	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
wisdom	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
so	1
brave	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
depth	1
of	1
despair	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
concealment	1
she	1
said	1
alas	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
already	1
and	1
besides	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
can	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
endured	1
than	1
i	1
suffer	1
now	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
new	1
hope	1
or	1
of	1
new	1
courage	1
to	1
me	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
fixedly	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
and	1
said	1
suddenly	1
but	1
quietly	1
but	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
afraid	1
not	1
for	1
yourself	1
but	1
for	1
others	1
from	1
yourself	1
after	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
her	1
face	1
grew	1
set	1
in	1
its	1
lines	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
shone	1
with	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
a	1
martyr	1
as	1
she	1
answered	1
ah	1
no	1
for	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
asked	1
gently	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
very	1
still	1
for	1
each	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
way	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
vague	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
her	1
answer	1
came	1
with	1
direct	1
simplicity	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
simply	1
stating	1
a	1
fact	1
because	1
if	1
i	1
find	1
in	1
myself	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
watch	1
keenly	1
for	1
it	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
harm	1
to	1
any	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
i	1
shall	1
die	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
kill	1
yourself	1
he	1
asked	1
hoarsely	1
i	1
would	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
friend	1
who	1
loved	1
me	1
who	1
would	1
save	1
me	1
such	1
a	1
pain	1
and	1
so	1
desperate	1
an	1
effort	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
meaningly	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
down	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
solemnly	1
my	1
child	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
your	1
good	1
for	1
myself	1
i	1
could	1
hold	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
account	1
with	1
god	1
to	1
find	1
such	1
an	1
euthanasia	1
for	1
you	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
best	1
nay	1
were	1
it	1
safe	1
but	1
my	1
child	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
seemed	1
choked	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
sob	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
he	1
gulped	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
there	1
are	1
here	1
some	1
who	1
would	1
stand	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
death	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
die	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
die	1
by	1
any	1
hand	1
but	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
by	1
your	1
own	1
until	1
the	1
other	1
who	1
has	1
fouled	1
your	1
sweet	1
life	1
is	1
true	1
dead	1
you	1
must	1
not	1

for	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
quick	1
undead	1
your	1
death	1
would	1
make	1
you	1
even	1
as	1
he	1

no	1
you	1

live	1
you	1

death	1
would	1
seem	1
a	1
boon	1
unspeakable	1
you	1

fight	1
death	1
himself	1

not	1
die	1
nay	1
nor	1
think	1
of	1
death	1
till	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
be	1
past	1
the	1
poor	1
dear	1
grew	1
white	1
as	1
death	1
and	1
shook	1
and	1
shivered	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
quicksand	1
shake	1
and	1
shiver	1
at	1
the	1
incoming	1
of	1
the	1
tide	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
silent	1
we	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
grew	1
more	1
calm	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
sweetly	1
but	1
oh	1
so	1
sorrowfully	1
as	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
that	1
if	1
god	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
live	1
i	1
shall	1
strive	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
till	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
good	1
time	1
this	1
horror	1
may	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
and	1
brave	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
our	1
hearts	1
were	1
strengthened	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
endure	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
discuss	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
in	1
the	1
safe	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
or	1
diaries	1
and	1
phonographs	1
we	1
might	1
hereafter	1
use	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
record	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
pleased	1
could	1
be	1
used	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
so	1
grim	1
an	1
interest	1
as	1
usual	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
thought	1
ahead	1
of	1
everyone	1
else	1
and	1
was	1
prepared	1
with	1
an	1
exact	1
ordering	1
of	1
our	1
work	1
it	1
is	1
perhaps	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
at	1
our	1
meeting	1
after	1
our	1
visit	1
to	1
carfax	1
we	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
the	1
earthboxes	1
that	1
lay	1
there	1
had	1
we	1
done	1
so	1
the	1
count	1
must	1
have	1
guessed	1
our	1
purpose	1
and	1
would	1
doubtless	1
have	1
taken	1
measures	1
in	1
advance	1
to	1
frustrate	1
such	1
an	1
effort	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
our	1
intentions	1
nay	1
more	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
exists	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
can	1
sterilise	1
his	1
lairs	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
use	1
them	1
as	1
of	1
old	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
further	1
advanced	1
in	1
our	1
knowledge	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
disposition	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
examined	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
we	1
may	1
track	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
today	1
then	1
is	1
ours	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
rests	1
our	1
hope	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
rose	1
on	1
our	1
sorrow	1
this	1
morning	1
guards	1
us	1
in	1
its	1
course	1
until	1
it	1
sets	1
tonight	1
that	1
monster	1
must	1
retain	1
whatever	1
form	1
he	1
now	1
has	1
he	1
is	1
confined	1
within	1
the	1
limitations	1
of	1
his	1
earthly	1
envelope	1
he	1
cannot	1
melt	1
into	1
thin	1
air	1
nor	1
disappear	1
through	1
cracks	1
or	1
chinks	1
or	1
crannies	1
if	1
he	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
doorway	1
he	1
must	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
like	1
a	1
mortal	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
hunt	1
out	1
all	1
his	1
lairs	1
and	1
sterilise	1
them	1
so	1
we	1
shall	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
catch	1
him	1
and	1
destroy	1
him	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
bay	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
catching	1
and	1
the	1
destroying	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
sure	1
here	1
i	1
started	1
up	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
minutes	1
and	1
seconds	1
so	1
preciously	1
laden	1
with	1
minas	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
were	1
flying	1
from	1
us	1
since	1
whilst	1
we	1
talked	1
action	1
was	1
impossible	1
but	1
van	1
helsing	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
warningly	1
nay	1
friend	1
jonathan	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
quickest	1
way	1
home	1
is	1
the	1
longest	1
way	1
so	1
your	1
proverb	1
say	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
act	1
and	1
act	1
with	1
desperate	1
quick	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
but	1
think	1
in	1
all	1
probable	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
the	1
count	1
may	1
have	1
many	1
houses	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
bought	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
deeds	1
of	1
purchase	1
keys	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
paper	1
that	1
he	1
write	1
on	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
his	1
book	1
of	1
cheques	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
belongings	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
somewhere	1
why	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
so	1
central	1
so	1
quiet	1
where	1
he	1
come	1
and	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
front	1
or	1
the	1
back	1
at	1
all	1
hour	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
vast	1
of	1
the	1
traffic	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
notice	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
search	1
that	1
house	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
learn	1
what	1
it	1
holds	1
then	1
we	1
do	1
what	1
our	1
friend	1
arthur	1
call	1
in	1
his	1
phrases	1
of	1
hunt	1
stop	1
the	1
earths	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
run	1
down	1
our	1
old	1
fox	1
so	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
then	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
cried	1
we	1
are	1
wasting	1
the	1
precious	1
precious	1
time	1
the	1
professor	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
but	1
simply	1
said	1
and	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
that	1
house	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
any	1
way	1
i	1
cried	1
we	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
if	1
need	1
be	1
and	1
your	1
police	1
where	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
they	1
say	1
i	1
was	1
staggered	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
delay	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
reason	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
dont	1
wait	1
more	1
than	1
need	1
be	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
what	1
torture	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
ah	1
my	1
child	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
indeed	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
anguish	1
but	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
can	1
we	1
do	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
be	1
at	1
movement	1
then	1
will	1
come	1
our	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
simplest	1
way	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
now	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
key	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
i	1
nodded	1
now	1
suppose	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
truth	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
still	1
get	1
it	1
and	1
think	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
you	1
no	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
housebreaker	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
do	1
i	1
should	1
get	1
a	1
respectable	1
locksmith	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
pick	1
the	1
lock	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
your	1
police	1
they	1
would	1
interfere	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
oh	1
no	1
not	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
properly	1
employed	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
keenly	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
doubt	1
is	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
employer	1
and	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
your	1
policemen	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
that	1
employer	1
has	1
a	1
good	1
conscience	1
or	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
your	1
police	1
must	1
indeed	1
be	1
zealous	1
men	1
and	1
clever	1
oh	1
so	1
clever	1
in	1
reading	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
they	1
trouble	1
themselves	1
in	1
such	1
matter	1
no	1
no	1
my	1
friend	1
jonathan	1
you	1
go	1
take	1
the	1
lock	1
off	1
a	1
hundred	1
empty	1
house	1
in	1
this	1
your	1
london	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
rightly	1
done	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
rightly	1
done	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
interfere	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
owned	1
a	1
so	1
fine	1
house	1
in	1
your	1
london	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
for	1
months	1
of	1
summer	1
to	1
switzerland	1
and	1
lock	1
up	1
his	1
house	1
some	1
burglar	1
came	1
and	1
broke	1
window	1
at	1
back	1
and	1
got	1
in	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
made	1
open	1
the	1
shutters	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
walk	1
out	1
and	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
the	1
very	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
police	1
then	1
he	1
have	1
an	1
auction	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
and	1
advertise	1
it	1
and	1
put	1
up	1
big	1
notice	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
come	1
he	1
sell	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
auctioneer	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
man	1
who	1
own	1
them	1
then	1
he	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
builder	1
and	1
he	1
sell	1
him	1
that	1
house	1
making	1
an	1
agreement	1
that	1
he	1
pull	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
take	1
all	1
away	1
within	1
a	1
certain	1
time	1
and	1
your	1
police	1
and	1
other	1
authority	1
help	1
him	1
all	1
they	1
can	1
and	1
when	1
that	1
owner	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
his	1
holiday	1
in	1
switzerland	1
he	1

only	1
an	1
empty	1
hole	1
where	1
his	1
house	1

the	1
policemen	1
who	1
have	1
then	1
little	1
to	1
think	1

shall	1
go	1
after	1
ten	1
oclock	1
when	1

of	1

could	1
not	1

see	1
how	1
right	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
the	1
terrible	1
despair	1
of	1

carriages	1
where	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
convenient	1
look	1
here	1
old	1
fellow	1
said	1
morris	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
idea	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
ready	1
in	1
case	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
horsebacking	1
but	1
dont	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
snappy	1
carriages	1
with	1
its	1
heraldic	1
adornments	1
in	1
a	1
byway	1
of	1
walworth	1
or	1
mile	1
end	1
would	1
attract	1
too	1
much	1
attention	1
for	1
our	1
purposes	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
cabs	1
when	1
we	1
go	1
south	1
or	1
east	1
and	1
even	1
leave	1
them	1
somewhere	1
near	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
friend	1
quincey	1
is	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
professor	1
his	1
head	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
call	1
in	1
plane	1
with	1
the	1
horizon	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
difficult	1
thing	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
no	1
peoples	1
to	1
watch	1
us	1
if	1
so	1
it	1
may	1
mina	1
took	1
a	1
growing	1
interest	1
in	1
everything	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
exigency	1
of	1
affairs	1
was	1
helping	1
her	1
to	1
forget	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
the	1
terrible	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
pale	1
almost	1
ghastly	1
and	1
so	1
thin	1
that	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
drawn	1
away	1
showing	1
her	1
teeth	1
in	1
somewhat	1
of	1
prominence	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
mention	1
this	1
last	1
lest	1
it	1
should	1
give	1
her	1
needless	1
pain	1
but	1
it	1
made	1
my	1
blood	1
run	1
cold	1
in	1
my	1
veins	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
with	1
poor	1
lucy	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
sucked	1
her	1
blood	1
as	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
teeth	1
growing	1
sharper	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
as	1
yet	1
was	1
short	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
fear	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
our	1
efforts	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
our	1
forces	1
there	1
were	1
new	1
sources	1
of	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
finally	1
agreed	1
that	1
before	1
starting	1
for	1
piccadilly	1
we	1
should	1
destroy	1
the	1
counts	1
lair	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
too	1
soon	1
we	1
should	1
thus	1
be	1
still	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
our	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
in	1
his	1
purely	1
material	1
shape	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
weakest	1
might	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
new	1
clue	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
forces	1
it	1
was	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
professor	1
that	1
after	1
our	1
visit	1
to	1
carfax	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
enter	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
doctors	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
remain	1
there	1
whilst	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
quincey	1
found	1
the	1
lairs	1
at	1
walworth	1
and	1
mile	1
end	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
if	1
not	1
likely	1
the	1
professor	1
urged	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
might	1
appear	1
in	1
piccadilly	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
so	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
cope	1
with	1
him	1
then	1
and	1
there	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
in	1
force	1
to	1
this	1
plan	1
i	1
strenuously	1
objected	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
my	1
going	1
was	1
concerned	1
for	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
i	1
intended	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
protect	1
mina	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
mina	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
my	1
objection	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
law	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
be	1
useful	1
that	1
amongst	1
the	1
counts	1
papers	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
clue	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
understand	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
experience	1
in	1
transylvania	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
we	1
could	1
muster	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
cope	1
with	1
the	1
counts	1
extraordinary	1
power	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
for	1
minas	1
resolution	1
was	1
fixed	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
hope	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
work	1
together	1
as	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
things	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
and	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen	1
must	1
have	1
in	1
it	1
some	1
element	1
of	1
hope	1
or	1
comfort	1
go	1
my	1
husband	1
god	1
can	1
if	1
he	1
wishes	1
it	1
guard	1
me	1
as	1
well	1
alone	1
as	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
present	1
so	1
i	1
started	1
up	1
crying	1
out	1
then	1
in	1
gods	1
name	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
losing	1
time	1
the	1
count	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
piccadilly	1
earlier	1
than	1
we	1
think	1
not	1
so	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
why	1
i	1
asked	1
do	1
you	1
forget	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
actually	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
last	1
night	1
he	1
banqueted	1
heavily	1
and	1
will	1
sleep	1
late	1
did	1
i	1
forget	1
shall	1
i	1
ever	1
can	1
i	1
ever	1
can	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
ever	1
forget	1
that	1
terrible	1
scene	1
mina	1
struggled	1
hard	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
brave	1
countenance	1
but	1
the	1
pain	1
overmastered	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
shuddered	1
whilst	1
she	1
moaned	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
to	1
recall	1
her	1
frightful	1
experience	1
he	1
had	1
simply	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
in	1
his	1
intellectual	1
effort	1
when	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
his	1
thoughtlessness	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
oh	1
madam	1
mina	1
he	1
said	1
dear	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
alas	1
that	1
i	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
so	1
reverence	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
said	1
anything	1
so	1
forgetful	1
these	1
stupid	1
old	1
lips	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
this	1
stupid	1
old	1
head	1
do	1
not	1
deserve	1
so	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
forget	1
it	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
he	1
bent	1
low	1
beside	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
she	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
said	1
hoarsely	1
no	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
that	1
i	1
remember	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
memory	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
sweet	1
that	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
all	1
together	1
now	1
you	1
must	1
all	1
be	1
going	1
soon	1
breakfast	1
is	1
ready	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
eat	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
strong	1
breakfast	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
meal	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
cheerful	1
and	1
encourage	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
mina	1
was	1
the	1
brightest	1
and	1
most	1
cheerful	1
of	1
us	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
van	1
helsing	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
now	1
my	1
dear	1
friends	1
we	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
our	1
terrible	1
enterprise	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
armed	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
when	1
first	1
we	1
visited	1
our	1
enemys	1
lair	1
armed	1
against	1
ghostly	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
carnal	1
attack	1
we	1
all	1
assured	1
him	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
now	1
madam	1
mina	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
quite	1
safe	1
here	1
until	1
the	1
sunset	1
and	1
before	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
return	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
return	1
but	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
you	1
armed	1
against	1
personal	1
attack	1
i	1
have	1
myself	1
since	1
you	1
came	1
down	1
prepared	1
your	1
chamber	1
by	1
the	1
placing	1
of	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
enter	1
now	1
let	1
me	1
guard	1
yourself	1
on	1
your	1
forehead	1
i	1
touch	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
sacred	1
wafer	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fearful	1
scream	1
which	1
almost	1
froze	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
hear	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
wafer	1
on	1
minas	1
forehead	1
it	1
had	1
seared	1
it	1
had	1
burned	1
into	1
the	1
flesh	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
whitehot	1
metal	1
my	1
poor	1
darlings	1
brain	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
her	1
nerves	1
received	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
so	1
overwhelmed	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
overwrought	1
nature	1
had	1
its	1
voice	1
in	1
that	1
dreadful	1
scream	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
thought	1
came	1
quickly	1
the	1
echo	1
of	1
the	1
scream	1
had	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
ring	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
reaction	1
and	1
she	1
sand	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
abasement	1
pulling	1
her	1
beautiful	1
hair	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
leper	1
of	1
old	1
his	1
mantle	1
she	1
wailed	1
out	1
unclean	1
unclean	1
even	1
the	1
almighty	1
shuns	1
my	1
polluted	1
flesh	1
i	1
must	1
bear	1
this	1
mark	1
of	1
shame	1
upon	1
my	1
forehead	1
until	1
the	1
judgement	1
day	1
they	1
all	1
paused	1
i	1
had	1
thrown	1
myself	1
beside	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
helpless	1
grief	1
and	1
putting	1
my	1
arms	1
around	1
held	1
her	1
tight	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
our	1
sorrowful	1
hearts	1
beat	1
together	1
whilst	1
the	1
friends	1
around	1
us	1
turned	1
away	1
their	1
eyes	1
that	1
ran	1
tears	1
silently	1
then	1
van	1
helsing	1
turned	1
and	1
said	1
gravely	1
so	1
gravely	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
inspired	1
and	1
was	1
stating	1
things	1
outside	1
himself	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
that	1
mark	1
till	1
god	1
himself	1
see	1
fit	1
as	1
he	1
most	1
surely	1
shall	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
day	1
to	1
redress	1
all	1
wrongs	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
placed	1
thereon	1
and	1
oh	1
madam	1
mina	1
my	1
dear	1
my	1
dear	1
may	1
we	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
be	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
when	1
that	1
red	1
scar	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
gods	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
leave	1
your	1
forehead	1
as	1
pure	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
we	1
know	1
for	1
so	1
surely	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
that	1
scar	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
when	1
god	1
sees	1
right	1
to	1
lift	1
the	1
burden	1
that	1
is	1
hard	1
upon	1
us	1
till	1
then	1
we	1
bear	1
our	1
cross	1
as	1
his	1
son	1
did	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
chosen	1
instruments	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
ascend	1
to	1
his	1
bidding	1
as	1
that	1
other	1
through	1
stripes	1
and	1
shame	1
through	1
tears	1
and	1
blood	1
through	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
god	1
and	1
man	1
there	1
was	1
hope	1
in	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
comfort	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
for	1
resignation	1
mina	1
and	1
i	1
both	1
felt	1
so	1
and	1
simultaneously	1
we	1
each	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
mans	1
hands	1
and	1
bent	1
over	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
then	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
we	1
all	1
knelt	1
down	1
together	1
and	1
all	1
holding	1
hands	1
swore	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
we	1
men	1
pledged	1
ourselves	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
sorrow	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
her	1
whom	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
we	1
loved	1
and	1
we	1
prayed	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
guidance	1
in	1
the	1
terrible	1
task	1
which	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
time	1
to	1
start	1
so	1
i	1
said	1
farewell	1
to	1
mina	1
a	1
parting	1
which	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
forget	1
to	1
our	1
dying	1
day	1
and	1
we	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
mina	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
vampire	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
that	1
unknown	1
and	1
terrible	1
land	1
alone	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
thus	1
that	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
one	1
vampire	1
meant	1
many	1
just	1
as	1
their	1
hideous	1
bodies	1
could	1
only	1
rest	1
in	1
sacred	1
earth	1
so	1
the	1
holiest	1
love	1
was	1
the	1
recruiting	1
sergeant	1
for	1
their	1
ghastly	1
ranks	1
we	1
entered	1
carfax	1
without	1
trouble	1
and	1
found	1
all	1
things	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
occasion	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
amongst	1
so	1
prosaic	1
surroundings	1
of	1
neglect	1
and	1
dust	1
and	1
decay	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
ground	1
for	1
such	1
fear	1
as	1
already	1
we	1
knew	1
had	1
not	1
our	1
minds	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
and	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
terrible	1
memories	1
to	1
spur	1
us	1
on	1
we	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
proceeded	1
with	1
our	1
task	1
we	1
found	1
no	1
papers	1
or	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
chapel	1
the	1
great	1
boxes	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
last	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
to	1
us	1
solemnly	1
as	1
we	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
now	1
my	1
friends	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
duty	1
here	1
to	1
do	1
we	1
must	1
sterilise	1
this	1
earth	1
so	1
sacred	1
of	1
holy	1
memories	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
distant	1
land	1
for	1
such	1
fell	1
use	1
he	1
has	1
chosen	1
this	1
earth	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
holy	1
thus	1
we	1
defeat	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
weapon	1
for	1
we	1
make	1
it	1
more	1
holy	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
sanctified	1
to	1
such	1
use	1
of	1
man	1
now	1
we	1
sanctify	1
it	1
to	1
god	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
bag	1
a	1
screwdriver	1
and	1
a	1
wrench	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cases	1
was	1
thrown	1
open	1
the	1
earth	1
smelled	1
musty	1
and	1
close	1
but	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
somehow	1
seem	1
to	1
mind	1
for	1
our	1
attention	1
was	1
concentrated	1
on	1
the	1
professor	1
taking	1
from	1
his	1
box	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
sacred	1
wafer	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
reverently	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
then	1
shutting	1
down	1
the	1
lid	1
began	1
to	1
screw	1
it	1
home	1
we	1
aiding	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
worked	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
we	1
treated	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
boxes	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
but	1
in	1
each	1
was	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
when	1
we	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
us	1
the	1
professor	1
said	1
solemnly	1
so	1
much	1
is	1
already	1
done	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
successful	1
then	1
the	1
sunset	1
of	1
this	1
evening	1
may	1
shine	1
on	1
madam	1
minas	1
forehead	1
all	1
white	1
as	1
ivory	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
stain	1
as	1
we	1
passed	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
to	1
catch	1
our	1
train	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
asylum	1
i	1
looked	1
eagerly	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
saw	1
mina	1
i	1
waved	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
nodded	1
to	1
tell	1
that	1
our	1
work	1
there	1
was	1
successfully	1
accomplished	1
she	1
nodded	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
the	1
last	1
i	1
saw	1
she	1
was	1
waving	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
farewell	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
heart	1
that	1
we	1
sought	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
just	1
caught	1
the	1
train	1
which	1
was	1
steaming	1
in	1
as	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
platform	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
piccadilly	1
1230	1
oclock	1
just	1
before	1
we	1
reached	1
fenchurch	1
street	1
lord	1
godalming	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
quincey	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
locksmith	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
case	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
difficulty	1
for	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
it	1
wouldnt	1
seem	1
so	1
bad	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
break	1
into	1
an	1
empty	1
house	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
solicitor	1
and	1
the	1
incorporated	1
law	1
society	1
might	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
better	1
i	1
demurred	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
not	1
sharing	1
any	1
danger	1
even	1
of	1
odium	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
besides	1
it	1
will	1
attract	1
less	1
attention	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
my	1
title	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
with	1
the	1
locksmith	1
and	1
with	1
any	1
policeman	1
that	1
may	1
come	1
along	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
with	1
jack	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
green	1
park	1
somewhere	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
smith	1
has	1
gone	1
away	1
do	1
you	1
all	1
come	1
across	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
let	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
advice	1
is	1
good	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
so	1
we	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
godalming	1
and	1
morris	1
hurried	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
we	1
following	1
in	1
another	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
arlington	1
street	1
our	1
contingent	1
got	1
our	1
and	1
strolled	1
into	1
the	1
green	1
park	1
my	1
heart	1
beat	1
as	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
our	1
hope	1
was	1
centered	1
looming	1
up	1
grim	1
and	1
silent	1
in	1
its	1
deserted	1
condition	1
amongst	1
its	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
sprucelooking	1
neighbours	1
we	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
within	1
good	1
view	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
smoke	1
cigars	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
attract	1
as	1
little	1
attention	1
as	1
possible	1
the	1
minutes	1
seemed	1
to	1
pass	1
with	1
leaden	1
feet	1
as	1
we	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
at	1
length	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
fourwheeler	1
drive	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
leisurely	1
fashion	1
got	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
morris	1
and	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
descended	1
a	1
thickset	1
working	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
rushwoven	1
basket	1
of	1
tools	1
morris	1
paid	1
the	1
cabman	1
who	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
drove	1
away	1
together	1
the	1
two	1
ascended	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
lord	1
godalming	1
pointed	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
done	1
the	1
workman	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
leisurely	1
and	1
hung	1
it	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spikes	1
of	1
the	1
rail	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
a	1
policeman	1
who	1
just	1
then	1
sauntered	1
along	1
the	1
policeman	1
nodded	1
acquiescence	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
kneeling	1
down	1
placed	1
his	1
bag	1
beside	1
him	1
after	1
searching	1
through	1
it	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
selection	1
of	1
tools	1
which	1
he	1
produced	1
to	1
lay	1
beside	1
him	1
in	1
orderly	1
fashion	1
then	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
keyhole	1
blew	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
employers	1
made	1
some	1
remark	1
lord	1
godalming	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
lifted	1
a	1
good	1
sized	1
bunch	1
of	1
keys	1
selecting	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
probe	1
the	1
lock	1
as	1
if	1
feeling	1
his	1
way	1
with	1
it	1
after	1
fumbling	1
about	1
for	1
a	1
bit	1
he	1
tried	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
third	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
under	1
a	1
slight	1
push	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
others	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
we	1
sat	1
still	1
my	1
own	1
cigar	1
burnt	1
furiously	1
but	1
van	1
helsings	1
went	1
cold	1
altogether	1
we	1
waited	1
patiently	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
workman	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
his	1
bag	1
then	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
door	1
partly	1
open	1
steadying	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
whilst	1
he	1
fitted	1
a	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
lock	1
this	1
he	1
finally	1
handed	1
to	1
lord	1
godalming	1
who	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
the	1
man	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
took	1
his	1
bag	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
departed	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
took	1
the	1
slightest	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
transaction	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
fairly	1
gone	1
we	1
three	1
crossed	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
it	1
was	1
immediately	1
opened	1
by	1
quincey	1
morris	1
beside	1
whom	1
stood	1
lord	1
godalming	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigar	1
the	1
place	1
smells	1
so	1
vilely	1
said	1
the	1
latter	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
in	1
it	1
did	1
indeed	1
smell	1
vilely	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
chapel	1
at	1
carfax	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
previous	1
experience	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
been	1
using	1
the	1
place	1
pretty	1
freely	1
we	1
moved	1
to	1
explore	1
the	1
house	1
all	1
keeping	1
together	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
attack	1
for	1
we	1
knew	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
wily	1
enemy	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
and	1
as	1
yet	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
count	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
diningroom	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
we	1
found	1
eight	1
boxes	1
of	1
earth	1
eight	1
boxes	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nine	1
which	1
we	1
sought	1
our	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
until	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
missing	1
box	1
first	1
we	1
opened	1
the	1
shutters	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
looked	1
out	1
across	1
a	1
narrow	1
stoneflagged	1
yard	1
at	1
the	1
blank	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
stable	1
pointed	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
miniature	1
house	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
windows	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
overlooked	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
any	1
time	1
in	1
examining	1
the	1
chests	1
with	1
the	1
tools	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
us	1
we	1
opened	1
them	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
treated	1
them	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
treated	1
those	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
chapel	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
we	1
proceeded	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
effects	1
after	1
a	1
cursory	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
rooms	1
from	1
basement	1
to	1
attic	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
contained	1
any	1
effects	1
which	1
might	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
proceeded	1
to	1
minutely	1
examine	1
them	1
they	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
orderly	1
disorder	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
diningroom	1
table	1
there	1
were	1
title	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
piccadilly	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
bundle	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
at	1
mile	1
end	1
and	1
bermondsey	1
notepaper	1
envelopes	1
and	1
pens	1
and	1
ink	1
all	1
were	1
covered	1
up	1
in	1
thin	1
wrapping	1
paper	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
a	1
clothes	1
brush	1
a	1
brush	1
and	1
comb	1
and	1
a	1
jug	1
and	1
basin	1
the	1
latter	1
containing	1
dirty	1
water	1
which	1
was	1
reddened	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
blood	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1
keys	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
sizes	1
probably	1
those	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
houses	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
examined	1

lord	1

accurate	1

addresses	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
south	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
keys	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
bunch	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
boxes	1
in	1
these	1
places	1
the	1

with	1
what	1

the	1
time	1
seemed	1
terribly	1
long	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1

for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1

and	1

the	1

tried	1
to	1
keep	1
our	1
minds	1
active	1
by	1
using	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
beneficent	1
purpose	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
glances	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
at	1
harker	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
is	1
overwhelmed	1
in	1
a	1
misery	1
that	1
is	1
appalling	1
to	1
see	1
last	1
night	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
frank	1
happylooking	1
man	1
with	1
strong	1
youthful	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
with	1
dark	1
brown	1
hair	1
today	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
drawn	1
haggard	1
old	1
man	1
whose	1
white	1
hair	1
matches	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
hollow	1
burning	1
eyes	1
and	1
griefwritten	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
his	1
energy	1
is	1
still	1
intact	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
living	1
flame	1
this	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
his	1
salvation	1
for	1
if	1
all	1
go	1
well	1
it	1
will	1
tide	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
despairing	1
period	1
he	1
will	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
way	1
wake	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
life	1
poor	1
fellow	1
i	1
thought	1
my	1
own	1
trouble	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
but	1
his	1
the	1
professor	1
knows	1
this	1
well	1
enough	1
and	1
is	1
doing	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
mind	1
active	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
saying	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
absorbing	1
interest	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
remember	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
have	1
studied	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
since	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
relating	1
to	1
this	1
monster	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
have	1
studied	1
the	1
greater	1
seems	1
the	1
necessity	1
to	1
utterly	1
stamp	1
him	1
out	1
all	1
through	1
there	1
are	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
advance	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
but	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
researches	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
arminius	1
of	1
budapesth	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
life	1
a	1
most	1
wonderful	1
man	1
soldier	1
statesman	1
and	1
alchemist	1
which	1
latter	1
was	1
the	1
highest	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
mighty	1
brain	1
a	1
learning	1
beyond	1
compare	1
and	1
a	1
heart	1
that	1
knew	1
no	1
fear	1
and	1
no	1
remorse	1
he	1
dared	1
even	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
scholomance	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
branch	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
essay	1
well	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
brain	1
powers	1
survived	1
the	1
physical	1
death	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
memory	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
complete	1
in	1
some	1
faculties	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
child	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
growing	1
and	1
some	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
childish	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
are	1
now	1
of	1
mans	1
stature	1
he	1
is	1
experimenting	1
and	1
doing	1
it	1
well	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
crossed	1
his	1
path	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
yet	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
yet	1
if	1
we	1
fail	1
the	1
father	1
or	1
furtherer	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
order	1
of	1
beings	1
whose	1
road	1
must	1
lead	1
through	1
death	1
not	1
life	1
harker	1
groaned	1
and	1
said	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
arrayed	1
against	1
my	1
darling	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
experimenting	1
the	1
knowledge	1
may	1
help	1
us	1
to	1
defeat	1
him	1
he	1
has	1
all	1
along	1
since	1
his	1
coming	1
been	1
trying	1
his	1
power	1
slowly	1
but	1
surely	1
that	1
big	1
childbrain	1
of	1
his	1
working	1
well	1
for	1
us	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
yet	1
a	1
childbrain	1
for	1
had	1
he	1
dared	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
attempt	1
certain	1
things	1
he	1
would	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1
our	1
power	1
however	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
succeed	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
centuries	1
before	1
him	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
slow	1
festina	1
lente	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
his	1
motto	1
i	1
fail	1
to	1
understand	1
said	1
harker	1
wearily	1
oh	1
do	1
be	1
more	1
plain	1
to	1
me	1
perhaps	1
grief	1
and	1
trouble	1
are	1
dulling	1
my	1
brain	1
the	1
professor	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
tenderly	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
ah	1
my	1
child	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
plain	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
of	1
late	1
this	1
monster	1
has	1
been	1
creeping	1
into	1
knowledge	1
experimentally	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
zoophagous	1
patient	1
to	1
effect	1
his	1
entry	1
into	1
friend	1
johns	1
home	1
for	1
your	1
vampire	1
though	1
in	1
all	1
afterwards	1
he	1
can	1
come	1
when	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
will	1
must	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
make	1
entry	1
only	1
when	1
asked	1
thereto	1
by	1
an	1
inmate	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
most	1
important	1
experiments	1
do	1
we	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
all	1
these	1
so	1
great	1
boxes	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
others	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
then	1
but	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
childbrain	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
growing	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
consider	1
whether	1
might	1
not	1
himself	1
move	1
the	1
box	1
so	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
be	1
allright	1
he	1
try	1
to	1
move	1
them	1
all	1
alone	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
progress	1
and	1
he	1
scatter	1
these	1
graves	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
none	1
but	1
he	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
hidden	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
intend	1
to	1
bury	1
them	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
use	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
or	1
at	1
such	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
change	1
his	1
form	1
they	1
do	1
him	1
equal	1
well	1
and	1
none	1
may	1
know	1
these	1
are	1
his	1
hiding	1
place	1
but	1
my	1
child	1
do	1
not	1
despair	1
this	1
knowledge	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
too	1
late	1
already	1
all	1
of	1
his	1
lairs	1
but	1
one	1
be	1
sterilise	1
as	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
sunset	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
then	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
can	1
move	1
and	1
hide	1
i	1
delayed	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
so	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
more	1
at	1
stake	1
for	1
us	1
than	1
for	1
him	1
then	1
why	1
we	1
not	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
careful	1
than	1
him	1
by	1
my	1
clock	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
hour	1
and	1
already	1
if	1
all	1
be	1
well	1
friend	1
arthur	1
and	1
quincey	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
us	1
today	1
is	1
our	1
day	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
sure	1
if	1
slow	1
and	1
lose	1
no	1
chance	1
see	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
when	1
those	1

he	1
went	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1

he	1
could	1
only	1

he	1
went	1
from	1

first	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
suspect	1

you	1

at	1
bermondsey	1
only	1
a	1

time	1

him	1
some	1
time	1
for	1

have	1
to	1
be	1

me	1
my	1
friends	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
long	1
to	1
wait	1
now	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
ready	1
some	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
throw	1
away	1
no	1

he	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
warning	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
for	1
we	1
all	1
could	1
hear	1
a	1
key	1
softly	1
inserted	1
in	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
admire	1
even	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
dominant	1
spirit	1
asserted	1
itself	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
hunting	1
parties	1
and	1
adventures	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
quincey	1
morris	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
action	1
and	1
arthur	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
obey	1
him	1
implicitly	1
now	1
the	1
old	1
habit	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
renewed	1
instinctively	1
with	1
a	1
swift	1
glance	1
around	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
laid	1
out	1
our	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
and	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
placed	1
us	1
each	1
in	1
position	1
van	1
helsing	1
harker	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
just	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
opened	1
the	1
professor	1
could	1
guard	1
it	1
whilst	1
we	1
two	1
stepped	1
between	1
the	1
incomer	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
godalming	1
behind	1
and	1
quincey	1
in	1
front	1
stood	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
ready	1
to	1
move	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
we	1
waited	1
in	1
a	1
suspense	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
seconds	1
pass	1
with	1
nightmare	1
slowness	1
the	1
slow	1
careful	1
steps	1
came	1
along	1
the	1
hall	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
evidently	1
prepared	1
for	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
feared	1
it	1
suddenly	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
bound	1
he	1
leaped	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
winning	1
a	1
way	1
past	1
us	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
could	1
raise	1
a	1
hand	1
to	1
stay	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
so	1
pantherlike	1
in	1
the	1
movement	1
something	1
so	1
unhuman	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
sober	1
us	1
all	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
act	1
was	1
harker	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
movement	1
threw	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
leading	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
count	1
saw	1
us	1
a	1
horrible	1
sort	1
of	1
snarl	1
passed	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
showing	1
the	1
eyeteeth	1
long	1
and	1
pointed	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
smile	1
as	1
quickly	1
passed	1
into	1
a	1
cold	1
stare	1
of	1
lionlike	1
disdain	1
his	1
expression	1
again	1
changed	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
impulse	1
we	1
all	1
advanced	1
upon	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
some	1
better	1
organised	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
for	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
wondered	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
myself	1
know	1
whether	1
our	1
lethal	1
weapons	1
would	1
avail	1
us	1
anything	1
harker	1
evidently	1
meant	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
matter	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
ready	1
his	1
great	1
kukri	1
knife	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
fierce	1
and	1
sudden	1
cut	1
at	1
him	1
the	1
blow	1
was	1
a	1
powerful	1
one	1
only	1
the	1
diabolical	1
quickness	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
leap	1
back	1
saved	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
less	1
and	1
the	1
trenchant	1
blade	1
had	1
shorne	1
through	1
his	1
heart	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
point	1
just	1
cut	1
the	1
cloth	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
making	1
a	1
wide	1
gap	1
whence	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
banknotes	1
and	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
gold	1
fell	1
out	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
hellish	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
feared	1
for	1
harker	1
though	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
throw	1
the	1
terrible	1
knife	1
aloft	1
again	1
for	1
another	1
stroke	1
instinctively	1
i	1
moved	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
protective	1
impulse	1
holding	1
the	1
crucifix	1
and	1
wafer	1
in	1
my	1
lefthand	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
mighty	1
power	1
fly	1
along	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
surprise	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
cower	1
back	1
before	1
a	1
similar	1
movement	1
made	1
spontaneously	1
by	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
hate	1
and	1
baffled	1
malignity	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
hellish	1
rage	1
which	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
counts	1
face	1
his	1
waxen	1
hue	1
became	1
greenishyellow	1
by	1
the	1
contrast	1
of	1
his	1
burning	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
showed	1
on	1
the	1
pallid	1
skin	1
like	1
a	1
palpitating	1
wound	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
with	1
a	1
sinuous	1
dive	1
he	1
swept	1
under	1
harkers	1
arm	1
ere	1
his	1
blow	1
could	1
fall	1
and	1
grasping	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
dashed	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
threw	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
amid	1
the	1
crash	1
and	1
glitter	1
of	1
the	1
falling	1
glass	1
he	1
tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
flagged	1
area	1
below	1
through	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
shivering	1
glass	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
ting	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
flagging	1
we	1
ran	1
over	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
spring	1
unhurt	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
rushing	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
crossed	1
the	1
flagged	1
yard	1
and	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
stable	1
door	1
there	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
us	1
you	1
think	1
to	1
baffle	1
me	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
pale	1
faces	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
like	1
sheep	1
in	1
a	1
butchers	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
sorry	1
yet	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
rest	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
more	1
my	1
revenge	1
is	1
just	1
begun	1
i	1
spread	1
it	1
over	1
centuries	1
and	1
time	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
your	1
girls	1
that	1
you	1
all	1
love	1
are	1
mine	1
already	1
and	1
through	1
them	1
you	1
and	1
others	1
shall	1
yet	1
be	1
mine	1
my	1
creatures	1
to	1
do	1
my	1
bidding	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
jackals	1
when	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
feed	1
bah	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
sneer	1
he	1
passed	1
quickly	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
rusty	1
bolt	1
creak	1
as	1
he	1
fastened	1
it	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
door	1
beyond	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
us	1
to	1
speak	1
was	1
the	1
professor	1
as	1
realising	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
following	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
stable	1
we	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
hall	1
we	1
have	1
learnt	1
something	1
much	1
notwithstanding	1
his	1
brave	1
words	1
he	1
fears	1
us	1
he	1
fear	1
time	1
he	1
fear	1
want	1
for	1
if	1
not	1
why	1
he	1
hurry	1
so	1
his	1
very	1
tone	1
betray	1
him	1
or	1
my	1
ears	1
deceive	1
why	1
take	1
that	1
money	1
you	1
follow	1
quick	1
you	1
are	1
hunters	1
of	1
wild	1
beast	1
and	1
understand	1
it	1
so	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
nothing	1
here	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
return	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
money	1
remaining	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
took	1
the	1
titledeeds	1
in	1
the	1
bundle	1
as	1
harker	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
swept	1
the	1
remaining	1
things	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
fireplace	1
where	1
he	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
match	1
godalming	1
and	1
morris	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
harker	1
had	1
lowered	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
had	1
however	1
bolted	1
the	1
stable	1
door	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
forced	1
it	1
open	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
inquiry	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
the	1
mews	1
was	1
deserted	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
depart	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
sunset	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
recognise	1
that	1
our	1
game	1
was	1
up	1
with	1
heavy	1
hearts	1
we	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
madam	1
mina	1
poor	1
poor	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
all	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
just	1
now	1
is	1
done	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
there	1
at	1
least	1
protect	1
her	1
but	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
despair	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
more	1
earthbox	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
when	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
all	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
well	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
as	1
bravely	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
comfort	1
harker	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
was	1
quite	1
broken	1
down	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
low	1
groan	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
suppress	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
sad	1
hearts	1
we	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
where	1
we	1
found	1
mrs	1
harker	1
waiting	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
which	1
did	1
honour	1
to	1
her	1
bravery	1
and	1
unselfishness	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
our	1
faces	1
her	1
own	1
became	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
death	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
two	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
in	1
secret	1
prayer	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
said	1
cheerfully	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
thank	1
you	1
all	1
enough	1
oh	1
my	1
poor	1
darling	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
husbands	1
grey	1
head	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
lay	1
your	1
poor	1
head	1
here	1
and	1
rest	1
it	1
all	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
well	1
dear	1
god	1
will	1
protect	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
so	1
will	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
good	1
intent	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
only	1
groaned	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
sublime	1
misery	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
perfunctory	1
supper	1
together	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
cheered	1
us	1
all	1
up	1
somewhat	1
it	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
mere	1
animal	1
heat	1
of	1
food	1
to	1
hungry	1
people	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
eaten	1
anything	1
since	1
breakfast	1
or	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
companionship	1
may	1
have	1
helped	1
us	1
but	1
anyhow	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
less	1
miserable	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
morrow	1
as	1
not	1
altogether	1
without	1
hope	1
true	1
to	1
our	1
promise	1
we	1
told	1
mrs	1
harker	1
everything	1
which	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
although	1
she	1
grew	1
snowy	1
white	1
at	1
times	1
when	1
danger	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
threaten	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
red	1
at	1
others	1
when	1
his	1
devotion	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
manifested	1
she	1
listened	1
bravely	1
and	1
with	1
calmness	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
part	1
where	1
harker	1
had	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
so	1
recklessly	1
she	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
husbands	1
arm	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
tight	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
clinging	1
could	1
protect	1
him	1
from	1
any	1
harm	1
that	1
might	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
nothing	1
however	1
till	1
the	1
narration	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
and	1
matters	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
then	1
without	1
letting	1
go	1
her	1
husbands	1
hand	1
she	1
stood	1
up	1
amongst	1
us	1
and	1
spoke	1
oh	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
give	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
that	1
sweet	1
sweet	1
good	1
good	1
woman	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
radiant	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
youth	1
and	1
animation	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
and	1
which	1
we	1
saw	1
with	1
grinding	1
of	1
our	1
teeth	1
remembering	1
whence	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
came	1
her	1
loving	1
kindness	1
against	1
our	1
grim	1
hate	1
her	1
tender	1
faith	1
against	1
all	1
our	1
fears	1
and	1
doubting	1
and	1
we	1
knowing	1
that	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
symbols	1
went	1
she	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
goodness	1
and	1
purity	1
and	1
faith	1
was	1
outcast	1
from	1
god	1
jonathan	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
sounded	1
like	1
music	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
jonathan	1
dear	1
and	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
true	1
true	1
friends	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
bear	1
something	1
in	1
mind	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
dreadful	1
time	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
fight	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
destroy	1
even	1
as	1
you	1
destroyed	1
the	1
false	1
lucy	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
true	1
lucy	1
might	1
live	1
hereafter	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
hate	1
that	1
poor	1
soul	1
who	1
has	1
wrought	1
all	1
this	1
misery	1
is	1
the	1
saddest	1
case	1
of	1
all	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
joy	1
when	1
he	1
too	1
is	1
destroyed	1
in	1
his	1
worser	1
part	1
that	1
his	1
better	1
part	1
may	1
have	1
spiritual	1
immortality	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
pitiful	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
hold	1
your	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
destruction	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
husbands	1
face	1
darken	1
and	1
draw	1
together	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
passion	1
in	1
him	1
were	1
shriveling	1
his	1
being	1
to	1
its	1
core	1
instinctively	1
the	1
clasp	1
on	1
his	1
wifes	1
hand	1
grew	1
closer	1
till	1
his	1
knuckles	1
looked	1
white	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
flinch	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
which	1
i	1
knew	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
more	1
appealing	1
than	1
ever	1
as	1
she	1
stopped	1
speaking	1
he	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
almost	1
tearing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
hers	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
may	1
god	1
give	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
hand	1
just	1
for	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
destroy	1
that	1
earthly	1
life	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
aiming	1
at	1
if	1
beyond	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
send	1
his	1
soul	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever	1
to	1
burning	1
hell	1
i	1
would	1
do	1
it	1
oh	1
hush	1
oh	1
hush	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
god	1
dont	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
jonathan	1
my	1
husband	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
crush	1
me	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
horror	1
just	1
think	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
all	1
this	1
long	1
long	1
day	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
perhaps	1
some	1
day	1
i	1
too	1
may	1
need	1
such	1
pity	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
with	1
equal	1
cause	1
for	1
anger	1
may	1
deny	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
oh	1
my	1
husband	1
my	1
husband	1
indeed	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
spared	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
thought	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
another	1
way	1
but	1
i	1
pray	1
that	1
god	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
treasured	1
your	1
wild	1
words	1
except	1
as	1
the	1
heartbroken	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
loving	1
and	1
sorely	1
stricken	1
man	1
oh	1
god	1
let	1
these	1
poor	1
white	1
hairs	1
go	1
in	1
evidence	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
suffered	1
who	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
wrong	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
so	1
many	1
sorrows	1
have	1
come	1
we	1
men	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
tears	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
resisting	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
wept	1
openly	1
she	1
wept	1
too	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
her	1
sweeter	1
counsels	1
had	1
prevailed	1
her	1
husband	1
flung	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
van	1
helsing	1
beckoned	1
to	1

close	1
to	1
midnight	1
i	1
thought	1
yesterday	1
would	1
never	1
end	1
there	1
was	1
over	1
me	1
a	1
yearning	1
for	1
sleep	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
blind	1
belief	1
that	1
to	1
wake	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
find	1
things	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
any	1
change	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
before	1
we	1
parted	1
we	1
discussed	1
what	1
our	1
next	1
step	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
we	1
could	1
arrive	1
at	1
no	1
result	1
all	1
we	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
one	1
earthbox	1
remained	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
alone	1
knew	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
if	1
he	1
chooses	1
to	1
lie	1
hidden	1
he	1
may	1
baffle	1
us	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
the	1
thought	1
is	1
too	1
horrible	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
even	1
now	1
this	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
ever	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
all	1
perfection	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
my	1
poor	1
wronged	1
darling	1
i	1
love	1
her	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
for	1
her	1
sweet	1
pity	1
of	1
last	1
night	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
made	1
my	1
own	1
hate	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
seem	1
despicable	1
surely	1
god	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
the	1

to	1
be	1
the	1

by	1
the	1

this	1

is	1
sleeping	1
and	1
sleeping	1
without	1

i	1
fear	1
what	1
her	1
dreams	1
might	1
be	1
like	1
with	1
such	1
terrible	1
memories	1
to	1
ground	1
them	1
in	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
calm	1
within	1
my	1
seeing	1
since	1
the	1
sunset	1
then	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
there	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
a	1
repose	1
which	1
was	1
like	1
spring	1
after	1
the	1
blasts	1
of	1
march	1
i	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
sunset	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
somehow	1
now	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
deeper	1
meaning	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
sleepy	1
myself	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
weary	1
weary	1
to	1
death	1
however	1
i	1
must	1
try	1
to	1
sleep	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rest	1
for	1
me	1
until	1
later	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
awaked	1
by	1
mina	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
with	1
a	1
startled	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
easily	1
for	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
darkness	1
she	1
had	1
placed	1
a	1
warning	1
hand	1
over	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear	1
hush	1
there	1
is	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
softly	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
room	1
gently	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
just	1
outside	1
stretched	1
on	1
a	1
mattress	1

mr	1
morris	1
wide	1
awake	1
he	1
raised	1
a	1
warning	1
hand	1
for	1
silence	1
as	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
me	1
hush	1

dont	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
chances	1
his	1
look	1
and	1
gesture	1
forbade	1
discussion	1
so	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
told	1
mina	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
positively	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
stole	1
over	1
her	1
poor	1
pale	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
softly	1
oh	1
thank	1
god	1
for	1
good	1
brave	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
she	1
sank	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
sleep	1
i	1
write	1
this	1
now	1
as	1

making	1
the	1
windows	1
into	1
sharp	1
oblongs	1
and	1
the	1
gas	1
flame	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
speck	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
disc	1
of	1
light	1

and	1
matured	1
without	1
my	1
knowing	1

he	1

hypnotise	1
me	1
before	1

at	1
the	1

asking	1

when	1
the	1
professor	1
saw	1
mina	1
a	1
smile	1
a	1
positive	1
smile	1
ousted	1
the	1
anxiety	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands	1
as	1
he	1
said	1

back	1
to	1

today	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1

me	1
for	1
nothings	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
hypnotise	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
do	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
dawn	1
for	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
then	1
i	1
can	1
speak	1
and	1
speak	1
freely	1
be	1
quick	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
short	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
motioned	1
her	1
to	1
sit	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
looking	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
commenced	1
to	1
make	1
passes	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
from	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
downward	1
with	1
each	1
hand	1
in	1
turn	1
mina	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
fixedly	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
during	1
which	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
beat	1
like	1
a	1
trip	1
hammer	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
some	1
crisis	1
was	1
at	1
hand	1
gradually	1
her	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
stock	1
still	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
gentle	1
heaving	1
of	1
her	1
bosom	1
could	1
one	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
alive	1
the	1
professor	1
made	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
passes	1
and	1
then	1
stopped	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
forehead	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
great	1
beads	1
of	1
perspiration	1
mina	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
the	1
same	1
woman	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
faraway	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
had	1
a	1
sad	1
dreaminess	1
which	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
raising	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
impose	1
silence	1
the	1
professor	1
motioned	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
others	1
in	1
they	1
came	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
looking	1
on	1
mina	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
the	1
stillness	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
van	1
helsings	1
voice	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
level	1
tone	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
break	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
her	1
thoughts	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
the	1
answer	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
neutral	1
way	1

minutes	1
there	1
was	1

sat	1
rigid	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
her	1
fixedly	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us	1
hardly	1
dared	1
to	1
breathe	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
growing	1
lighter	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
minas	1
face	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
motioned	1
me	1
to	1
pull	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
seemed	1
just	1
upon	1
us	1
a	1
red	1
streak	1
shot	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
rosy	1
light	1
seemed	1
to	1
diffuse	1
itself	1
through	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
professor	1
spoke	1
again	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
now	1
the	1
answer	1
came	1
dreamily	1
but	1
with	1
intention	1
it	1
were	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
interpreting	1
something	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
her	1
use	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
when	1
reading	1
her	1
shorthand	1
notes	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
it	1

all	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
what	1

can	1
see	1
nothing	1

all	1
dark	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
i	1
could	1
detect	1
the	1
strain	1
in	1
the	1
professors	1
patient	1
voice	1
the	1
lapping	1
of	1
water	1
it	1

gurgling	1
by	1
and	1

something	1
each	1
from	1
the	1

we	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1

oh	1
yes	1
what	1
else	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
men	1
stamping	1
overhead	1
as	1
they	1
run	1
about	1

is	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
a	1

and	1
the	1
loud	1
tinkle	1
as	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

the	1
poor	1

brightened	1
up	1
considerably	1
already	1
the	1
certainty	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
has	1
given	1
her	1

and	1
comfort	1
is	1
strength	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
my	1

now	1

his	1
horrible	1
danger	1
is	1
not	1

with	1
us	1
it	1
seems	1
almost	1
impossible	1
to	1

in	1
it	1
even	1
my	1
own	1
terrible	1
experiences	1
in	1
castle	1

seem	1
like	1
a	1

in	1
the	1

autumn	1
air	1
in	1
the	1

alas	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
disbelieve	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
my	1
thought	1
my	1

fell	1
on	1

on	1
my	1

that	1

again	1

each	1

the	1

the	1

there	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
guiding	1
purpose	1
manifest	1
throughout	1
which	1
is	1
comforting	1
mina	1

that	1
perhaps	1
we	1

the	1

of	1

it	1
may	1

yet	1
of	1

it	1

that	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
quick	1
with	1
blood	1
for	1
that	1
his	1
ship	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
blood	1
before	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
tide	1
with	1
blood	1
then	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
smile	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
when	1
he	1
think	1
fit	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
surprise	1
if	1
he	1
go	1
quite	1
so	1
soon	1
the	1
captain	1
swear	1
again	1
polyglot	1
and	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
make	1
him	1
bow	1
and	1
thank	1
him	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
so	1
far	1
intrude	1
on	1
his	1
kindness	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
aboard	1
before	1
the	1
sailing	1
final	1
the	1
captain	1
more	1
red	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
in	1
more	1
tongues	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
doesnt	1
want	1
no	1
frenchmen	1
with	1
bloom	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
blood	1
in	1
his	1
ship	1
with	1
blood	1
on	1
her	1
also	1
and	1
so	1
after	1
asking	1
where	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
a	1
shop	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
purchase	1
ship	1
forms	1
he	1
departed	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
went	1
or	1
bloomin	1
well	1
cared	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
well	1
with	1
blood	1
again	1
for	1
it	1
soon	1
became	1
apparent	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
would	1
not	1
sail	1
as	1
was	1
expected	1
a	1
thin	1
mist	1
began	1
to	1
creep	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
and	1
grew	1
till	1
soon	1
a	1
dense	1
fog	1
enveloped	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
all	1
around	1
her	1
the	1
captain	1
swore	1
polyglot	1
very	1
polyglot	1
polyglot	1
with	1
bloom	1
and	1
blood	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
the	1
water	1
rose	1
and	1
rose	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
lose	1
the	1
tide	1
altogether	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
friendly	1
mood	1
when	1
just	1
at	1
full	1
tide	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
gangplank	1
again	1
and	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
his	1
box	1
had	1
been	1
stowed	1
then	1
the	1
captain	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
box	1
old	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
bloom	1
and	1
blood	1
were	1
in	1
hell	1
but	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
be	1
offend	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
mate	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
place	1
and	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
awhile	1
on	1
deck	1
in	1
fog	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
come	1
off	1
by	1
himself	1
for	1
none	1
notice	1
him	1
indeed	1
they	1
thought	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
soon	1
the	1
fog	1
begin	1
to	1
melt	1
away	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
clear	1
again	1
my	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
thirst	1
and	1
the	1
language	1
that	1
was	1
of	1
bloom	1
and	1
blood	1
laughed	1
as	1
they	1
told	1
how	1
the	1
captains	1
swears	1
exceeded	1
even	1
his	1
usual	1
polyglot	1
and	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
full	1
of	1
picturesque	1
when	1
on	1
questioning	1
other	1
mariners	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
movement	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
that	1
hour	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
seen	1
any	1
of	1
fog	1
at	1
all	1
except	1
where	1
it	1
lay	1
round	1
the	1
wharf	1
however	1
the	1
ship	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
ebb	1
tide	1
and	1
was	1
doubtless	1
by	1
morning	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
mouth	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
us	1
well	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
our	1
enemy	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
the	1
fog	1
at	1
his	1
command	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
danube	1
mouth	1
to	1
sail	1
a	1
ship	1
takes	1
time	1
go	1
she	1
never	1
so	1
quick	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
start	1
we	1
go	1
on	1
land	1
more	1
quick	1
and	1
we	1
meet	1
him	1
there	1
our	1
best	1
hope	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
box	1
between	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
for	1
then	1
he	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
struggle	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
deal	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
we	1
should	1
there	1
are	1
days	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
make	1
ready	1
our	1
plan	1
we	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
where	1
he	1
go	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
who	1
have	1
shown	1
us	1
invoices	1
and	1
all	1
papers	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
box	1
we	1
seek	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
landed	1
in	1
varna	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
an	1
agent	1
one	1
ristics	1
who	1
will	1
there	1
present	1
his	1
credentials	1
and	1
so	1
our	1
merchant	1
friend	1
will	1
have	1
done	1
his	1
part	1
when	1
he	1
ask	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wrong	1
for	1
that	1
so	1
he	1
can	1
telegraph	1
and	1
have	1
inquiry	1
made	1
at	1
varna	1
we	1
say	1
no	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
police	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
customs	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
us	1
alone	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
way	1
when	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
remained	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
he	1
replied	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
best	1

in	1
the	1
hypnotic	1
trance	1
this	1
morning	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
again	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
really	1
necessary	1
that	1
they	1
should	1

oh	1
i	1
dread	1
jonathan	1
leaving	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
surely	1
go	1
if	1
the	1
others	1
went	1
he	1
answered	1
in	1
growing	1
passion	1
at	1
first	1
quietly	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
however	1
he	1
grew	1
more	1
angry	1
and	1
more	1
forceful	1
till	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
see	1
wherein	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
personal	1
dominance	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
master	1
amongst	1
men	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
necessary	1
necessary	1
for	1

for	1
the	1

of	1

has	1
done	1
much	1
harm	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
scope	1
where	1
he	1
find	1
himself	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
as	1
a	1

small	1
measure	1
in	1

not	1

not	1

must	1
be	1
in	1

and	1
our	1
efforts	1
all	1
in	1
secret	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
enlightened	1
age	1
when	1

believe	1
not	1
even	1
what	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
doubting	1
of	1
wise	1

would	1
be	1
his	1

it	1

at	1
once	1
his	1

his	1

and	1
his	1

for	1
the	1
honour	1

glory	1
of	1
god	1
after	1
a	1
general	1
discussion	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
for	1
tonight	1
nothing	1
be	1
definitely	1
settled	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
sleep	1
on	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
think	1
out	1
the	1
proper	1
conclusions	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
breakfast	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
meet	1
again	1
and	1
after	1
making	1
our	1
conclusions	1
known	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
we	1
shall	1
decide	1
on	1
some	1
definite	1
cause	1
of	1
action	1
i	1
feel	1
a	1
wonderful	1
peace	1
and	1
rest	1
tonight	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
haunting	1
presence	1
were	1
removed	1
from	1
me	1
perhaps	1
my	1
surmise	1
was	1
not	1
finished	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
i	1
caught	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
mark	1
upon	1
my	1
forehead	1
and	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
still	1
unclean	1
dr	1
sewards	1
diary	1
5	1
october	1
we	1
all	1
rose	1
early	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
sleep	1
did	1
much	1
for	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
early	1
breakfast	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
general	1
cheerfulness	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
ever	1
expected	1
to	1
experience	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
wonderful	1
how	1
much	1
resilience	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
human	1
nature	1
let	1
any	1
obstructing	1
cause	1
no	1
matter	1
what	1
be	1
removed	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
even	1
by	1
death	1
and	1
we	1
fly	1
back	1
to	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
enjoyment	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
around	1
the	1
table	1
my	1
eyes	1
opened	1
in	1
wonder	1
whether	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
days	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
dream	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
i	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
blotch	1
on	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
forehead	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
reality	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
gravely	1
revolving	1
the	1
matter	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
to	1
realise	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
trouble	1
is	1
still	1
existent	1
even	1
mrs	1
harker	1
seems	1
to	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
trouble	1
for	1
whole	1
spells	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
when	1
something	1
recalls	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
thinks	1
of	1
her	1
terrible	1
scar	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
meet	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
study	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
decide	1
on	1
our	1
course	1
of	1
action	1
i	1
see	1
only	1
one	1
immediate	1
difficulty	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
by	1
instinct	1
rather	1
than	1
reason	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
frankly	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
mysterious	1
way	1
poor	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
tongue	1
is	1
tied	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
forms	1
conclusions	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
i	1
can	1
guess	1
how	1
brilliant	1
and	1
how	1
true	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
but	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
or	1
cannot	1
give	1
them	1
utterance	1
i	1
have	1
mentioned	1
this	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
i	1
are	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
alone	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
horrid	1
poison	1
which	1
has	1
got	1
into	1
her	1
veins	1
beginning	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
purposes	1
when	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
what	1
van	1
helsing	1
called	1
the	1
vampires	1
baptism	1
of	1
blood	1
well	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
poison	1
that	1
distils	1
itself	1
out	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
in	1
an	1
age	1
when	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
ptomaines	1
is	1
a	1
mystery	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
wonder	1
at	1
anything	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
instinct	1
be	1
true	1
regarding	1
poor	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
silences	1
then	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
difficulty	1
an	1
unknown	1
danger	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
same	1
power	1
that	1
compels	1
her	1
silence	1
may	1
compel	1
her	1
speech	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
think	1
further	1
for	1
so	1
i	1
should	1
in	1
my	1
thoughts	1
dishonour	1
a	1
noble	1
woman	1
van	1
helsing	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
my	1
study	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
the	1
others	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
subject	1
with	1
him	1
later	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
came	1
in	1
we	1
talked	1
over	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
which	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
felt	1
some	1
hesitancy	1
about	1
broaching	1
the	1
subject	1
after	1
beating	1
about	1
the	1
bush	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
friend	1
john	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
talk	1
of	1
alone	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
later	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
our	1
confidence	1
then	1
he	1
stopped	1
so	1
i	1
waited	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
madam	1
mina	1
our	1
poor	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
is	1
changing	1
a	1
cold	1
shiver	1
ran	1
through	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
worst	1
fears	1
thus	1
endorsed	1
van	1
helsing	1
continued	1
with	1
the	1
sad	1
experience	1
of	1
miss	1
lucy	1
we	1
must	1
this	1
time	1
be	1
warned	1
before	1
things	1
go	1
too	1
far	1
our	1
task	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
reality	1
more	1
difficult	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
this	1
new	1
trouble	1
makes	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
direst	1
importance	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
vampire	1
coming	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
but	1
very	1
very	1
slight	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
eyes	1
to	1
notice	1
without	1
to	1
prejudge	1
her	1
teeth	1
are	1
some	1
sharper	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
her	1
eyes	1
are	1
more	1
hard	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
silence	1
now	1
often	1
as	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
miss	1
lucy	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
later	1
now	1
my	1
fear	1
is	1
this	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
she	1
can	1
by	1
our	1
hypnotic	1
trance	1
tell	1
what	1
the	1
count	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
more	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
have	1
hypnotise	1
her	1
first	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
drink	1
of	1
her	1
very	1
blood	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
drink	1
of	1
his	1
should	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
compel	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
disclose	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
know	1
i	1
nodded	1
acquiescence	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
then	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
prevent	1
this	1
we	1
must	1
keep	1
her	1
ignorant	1
of	1
our	1
intent	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
know	1
not	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
painful	1
task	1
oh	1
so	1
painful	1
that	1
it	1
heartbreak	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
when	1
today	1
we	1
meet	1
i	1
must	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
for	1
reason	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
more	1
be	1
of	1
our	1
council	1
but	1
be	1
simply	1
guarded	1
by	1
us	1
he	1
wiped	1
his	1
forehead	1
which	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
in	1
profuse	1
perspiration	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
inflict	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
soul	1
already	1
so	1
tortured	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
also	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion	1
for	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
doubt	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
as	1
i	1
expected	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
our	1
general	1
gathering	1
van	1
helsing	1
has	1
gone	1
away	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
meeting	1
and	1
his	1
painful	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
really	1
believe	1
his	1
purpose	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
pray	1
alone	1
later	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
outset	1
of	1
our	1
meeting	1
a	1
great	1
personal	1
relief	1
was	1
experienced	1
by	1
both	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
myself	1
mrs	1
harker	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
join	1
us	1
at	1
present	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
free	1
to	1
discuss	1
our	1
movements	1
without	1
her	1
presence	1
to	1
embarrass	1
us	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
somehow	1
we	1
both	1
seemed	1
relieved	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
mrs	1
harker	1
realised	1
the	1
danger	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
pain	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
much	1
danger	1
averted	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
we	1
agreed	1
by	1
a	1
questioning	1
look	1
and	1
answer	1
with	1
finger	1
on	1
lip	1
to	1
preserve	1
silence	1
in	1
our	1
suspicions	1
until	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
confer	1
alone	1
again	1
we	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
our	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1
van	1
helsing	1
roughly	1
put	1
the	1
facts	1
before	1
us	1
first	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
left	1
the	1
thames	1
yesterday	1
morning	1
it	1
will	1
take	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
quickest	1
speed	1
she	1
has	1
ever	1
made	1
at	1
least	1
three	1
weeks	1
to	1
reach	1
varna	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
travel	1
overland	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
now	1
if	1
we	1
allow	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
less	1
for	1
the	1
ships	1
voyage	1
owing	1
to	1
such	1
weather	1
influences	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
can	1
bring	1
to	1
bear	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
allow	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
any	1
delays	1
which	1
may	1
occur	1
to	1
us	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
margin	1
of	1
nearly	1
two	1
weeks	1
thus	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
safe	1
we	1
must	1
leave	1
here	1
on	1
17th	1
at	1
latest	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
be	1
in	1
varna	1
a	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
ship	1
arrives	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
preparations	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
of	1
course	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
go	1
armed	1
armed	1
against	1
evil	1
things	1
spiritual	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
physical	1
here	1
quincey	1
morris	1
added	1
i	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
comes	1
from	1
a	1
wolf	1
country	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
get	1
there	1
before	1
us	1
i	1
propose	1
that	1
we	1
add	1
winchesters	1
to	1
our	1
armament	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
belief	1
in	1
a	1
winchester	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
trouble	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
around	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
art	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
pack	1
after	1
us	1
at	1
tobolsk	1
what	1
wouldnt	1
we	1
have	1
given	1
then	1
for	1
a	1
repeater	1

quinceys	1
head	1

at	1
all	1
times	1
but	1
most	1
so	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
hunt	1
though	1
my	1
metaphor	1
be	1
more	1
dishonour	1
to	1
science	1
than	1
wolves	1
be	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
here	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
varna	1
is	1
not	1
familiar	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
why	1
not	1
go	1
there	1
more	1
soon	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
long	1
to	1
wait	1
here	1
as	1
there	1
tonight	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
ready	1
and	1
then	1
if	1
all	1
be	1
well	1
we	1
four	1
can	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
we	1
four	1
said	1
harker	1
interrogatively	1
looking	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
us	1
of	1
course	1
answered	1
the	1
professor	1
quickly	1
you	1
must	1
remain	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
so	1
sweet	1
wife	1
harker	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
awhile	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
voice	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
consult	1
with	1
mina	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
now	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
van	1
helsing	1
to	1
warn	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
disclose	1
our	1
plans	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly	1
and	1
coughed	1
for	1
answer	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
turned	1

afternoon	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
our	1
meeting	1
this	1
morning	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
new	1
phases	1
of	1
things	1
leave	1
my	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
wonder	1
which	1
allows	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
active	1
thought	1
minas	1
determination	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
discussion	1
set	1
me	1
thinking	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
argue	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
guess	1
i	1
am	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
ever	1
from	1
a	1
solution	1
now	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
others	1
received	1
it	1
too	1
puzzled	1
me	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
we	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
we	1
agreed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
concealment	1
of	1
anything	1
amongst	1
us	1
mina	1
is	1
sleeping	1
now	1
calmly	1
and	1
sweetly	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
her	1
lips	1
are	1
curved	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
beams	1
with	1
happiness	1
thank	1
god	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
moments	1
still	1
for	1
her	1
later	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
i	1
sat	1
watching	1
minas	1
happy	1
sleep	1
and	1
came	1
as	1
near	1
to	1
being	1
happy	1
myself	1
as	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
evening	1
drew	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
took	1
its	1
shadows	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
sinking	1
lower	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
solemn	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
mina	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
tenderly	1
said	1
jonathan	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
promise	1
me	1
something	1
on	1
your	1
word	1
of	1
honour	1
a	1
promise	1
made	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
made	1
holily	1
in	1
gods	1
hearing	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
though	1
i	1
should	1
go	1
down	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
implore	1
you	1
with	1
bitter	1
tears	1
quick	1
you	1
must	1
make	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
mina	1
i	1
said	1
a	1
promise	1
like	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
make	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
may	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
but	1
dear	1
one	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
such	1
spiritual	1
intensity	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
like	1
pole	1
stars	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
who	1
wish	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
myself	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
right	1
if	1
he	1
disagrees	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
nay	1
more	1
if	1
you	1
all	1
agree	1
later	1
you	1
are	1
absolved	1
from	1
the	1
promise	1
i	1
promise	1
i	1
said	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
looked	1
supremely	1
happy	1
though	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
happiness	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
denied	1
by	1
the	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
she	1
said	1
promise	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
plans	1
formed	1
for	1
the	1
campaign	1
against	1
the	1
count	1
not	1
by	1
word	1
or	1
inference	1
or	1
implication	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
whilst	1
this	1
remains	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
she	1
solemnly	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
scar	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
earnest	1
and	1
said	1
solemnly	1
i	1
promise	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
it	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
door	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
between	1
us	1
later	1
midnight	1
mina	1
has	1
been	1
bright	1
and	1
cheerful	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
courage	1
as	1
if	1
infected	1
somewhat	1
with	1
her	1
gaiety	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
even	1
i	1
myself	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
pall	1
of	1
gloom	1
which	1
weighs	1
us	1
down	1
were	1
somewhat	1
lifted	1
we	1
all	1
retired	1
early	1
mina	1
is	1
now	1
sleeping	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
thing	1
that	1
her	1
faculty	1
of	1
sleep	1
remains	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
terrible	1
trouble	1
thank	1
god	1
for	1
it	1
for	1
then	1
at	1
least	1
she	1
can	1
forget	1
her	1
care	1
perhaps	1
her	1
example	1
may	1
affect	1
me	1
as	1
her	1
gaiety	1
did	1
tonight	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
it	1
oh	1
for	1
a	1
dreamless	1
sleep	1
6	1
october	1
morning	1
another	1
surprise	1
mina	1
woke	1
me	1
early	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
yesterday	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
occasion	1
for	1
hypnotism	1
and	1
without	1
question	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
expected	1
some	1
such	1
call	1
for	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
dressed	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
his	1
door	1
was	1
ajar	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
our	1
room	1
he	1
came	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
asked	1
mina	1
if	1
the	1
others	1
might	1
come	1
too	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
quite	1
simply	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
necessary	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
journey	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
startled	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
after	1
a	1
moments	1
pause	1
he	1
asked	1
but	1
why	1
you	1
must	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
safer	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
safer	1
too	1
but	1
why	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
safety	1
is	1
our	1
solemnest	1
duty	1
we	1
go	1
into	1
danger	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
liable	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
from	1
from	1
circumstances	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
paused	1
embarrassed	1
as	1
she	1
replied	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
finger	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
her	1
forehead	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
now	1
whilst	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
coming	1
up	1
i	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
again	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
wills	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
secret	1
i	1
must	1
come	1
by	1
wile	1
by	1
any	1
device	1
to	1
hoodwink	1
even	1
jonathan	1
god	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
that	1
she	1
turned	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
indeed	1
a	1
recording	1
angel	1
that	1
look	1
is	1
noted	1
to	1
her	1
everlasting	1
honour	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
clasp	1
her	1
hand	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
my	1
emotion	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
even	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
tears	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
you	1
men	1
are	1
brave	1
and	1
strong	1
you	1
are	1
strong	1
in	1
your	1
numbers	1
for	1
you	1
can	1
defy	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
human	1
endurance	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
guard	1
alone	1
besides	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
since	1
you	1
can	1
hypnotise	1
me	1
and	1
so	1
learn	1
that	1
which	1
even	1
i	1
myself	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
very	1
gravely	1
madam	1
mina	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
always	1
most	1
wise	1
you	1
shall	1
with	1
us	1
come	1
and	1
together	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
achieve	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
minas	1
long	1
spell	1
of	1
silence	1
made	1
me	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
back	1
on	1
her	1
pillow	1
asleep	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wake	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
let	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
which	1
flooded	1
the	1
room	1
van	1
helsing	1
motioned	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
quietly	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
within	1
a	1
minute	1
lord	1
godalming	1
dr	1
seward	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
also	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
mina	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
we	1
shall	1
leave	1
for	1
varna	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
factor	1
madam	1
mina	1
oh	1
but	1
her	1
soul	1
is	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
her	1
an	1
agony	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
right	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
warned	1
in	1
time	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
lost	1
and	1
in	1
varna	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
that	1
ship	1
arrives	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
exactly	1
asked	1
mr	1
morris	1
laconically	1
the	1
professor	1
paused	1
before	1
replying	1
we	1
shall	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
board	1
that	1
ship	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
identified	1
the	1
box	1
we	1
shall	1
place	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
rose	1
on	1
it	1
this	1
we	1
shall	1
fasten	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
there	1
none	1
can	1
emerge	1
so	1
at	1
least	1
says	1
the	1
superstition	1
and	1
to	1
superstition	1
must	1
we	1
trust	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
it	1
was	1

faith	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
and	1
it	1
have	1
its	1
root	1
in	1
faith	1
still	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
opportunity	1
that	1
we	1
seek	1
when	1
none	1
are	1
near	1
to	1
see	1
we	1
shall	1
open	1
the	1

will	1
be	1
well	1

not	1

it	1

wiped	1
out	1
for	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
i	1
grasped	1
his	1
hand	1
instinctively	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
as	1
firm	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
steel	1
i	1

jonathan	1
harker	1
has	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
note	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
hardly	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
and	1
he	1
wants	1
an	1
exact	1
record	1
kept	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
surprised	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
mrs	1
harker	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
sunset	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
late	1
come	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
are	1
to	1
her	1
times	1
of	1
peculiar	1
freedom	1
when	1
her	1
old	1
self	1
can	1
be	1
manifest	1
without	1
any	1
controlling	1
force	1
subduing	1
or	1
restraining	1
her	1
or	1
inciting	1
her	1
to	1
action	1
this	1
mood	1
or	1
condition	1
begins	1
some	1
half	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
before	1
actual	1
sunrise	1
or	1
sunset	1
and	1
lasts	1
till	1
either	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
high	1
or	1
whilst	1
the	1
clouds	1
are	1
still	1
aglow	1
with	1
the	1
rays	1
streaming	1
above	1
the	1
horizon	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
negative	1
condition	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
tie	1
were	1
loosened	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
absolute	1
freedom	1
quickly	1
follows	1
when	1
however	1
the	1
freedom	1
ceases	1
the	1
changeback	1
or	1
relapse	1
comes	1
quickly	1
preceded	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
spell	1
of	1
warning	1
silence	1
tonight	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
she	1
was	1
somewhat	1
constrained	1
and	1
bore	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
an	1
internal	1
struggle	1
i	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
myself	1
to	1
her	1
making	1
a	1
violent	1
effort	1
at	1
the	1
earliest	1
instant	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
so	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
minutes	1
however	1
gave	1
her	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
herself	1
then	1
motioning	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
sit	1
beside	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
half	1
reclining	1
she	1
made	1
the	1

taking	1
her	1

in	1
hers	1
began	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here	1
together	1
in	1
freedom	1
for	1
perhaps	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
i	1
know	1
dear	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
this	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
hand	1
had	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
tightened	1
upon	1
hers	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
upon	1
our	1
task	1
and	1
god	1
alone	1
knows	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1

so	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
brave	1
earnest	1
men	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
poor	1

woman	1
whose	1
soul	1
perhaps	1
is	1
lost	1
no	1
no	1
not	1
yet	1
but	1
is	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
at	1
stake	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
poison	1
in	1
my	1
blood	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
which	1
may	1
destroy	1
me	1
which	1
must	1
destroy	1
me	1
unless	1
some	1
relief	1
comes	1
to	1
us	1
oh	1
my	1
friends	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
way	1
out	1
for	1
me	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
she	1
looked	1
appealingly	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
turn	1
beginning	1
and	1
ending	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
way	1
asked	1
van	1
helsing	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
way	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
may	1
not	1
take	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
die	1
now	1
either	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
hand	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
another	1
before	1
the	1
greater	1
evil	1
is	1
entirely	1
wrought	1
i	1
know	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
were	1
i	1
once	1
dead	1
you	1
could	1
and	1
would	1
set	1
free	1
my	1
immortal	1
spirit	1
even	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
my	1
poor	1
lucys	1
were	1
death	1
or	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
shrink	1
to	1
die	1
here	1
now	1
amidst	1
the	1
friends	1
who	1
love	1
me	1
but	1
death	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
i	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
before	1
us	1
and	1
a	1
bitter	1
task	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
gods	1
will	1
therefore	1
i	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
give	1
up	1
here	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
eternal	1
rest	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
where	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
blackest	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
or	1
the	1
nether	1
world	1
holds	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
silent	1
for	1
we	1
knew	1
instinctively	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
prelude	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
set	1
and	1
harkers	1
grew	1
ashen	1
grey	1
perhaps	1
he	1
guessed	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
what	1
was	1
coming	1
she	1
continued	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
can	1
give	1
into	1
the	1
hotchpot	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
note	1
the	1
quaint	1
legal	1
phrase	1
which	1
she	1
used	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
seriousness	1
what	1
will	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
lives	1
i	1
know	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
quickly	1
that	1
is	1
easy	1
for	1
brave	1
men	1
your	1
lives	1
are	1
gods	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
them	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
give	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
looked	1
again	1
questioningly	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
avoided	1
her	1
husbands	1
face	1
quincey	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
he	1
nodded	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lit	1
up	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
plainly	1
what	1
i	1
want	1
for	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
doubtful	1
matter	1
in	1
this	1
connection	1
between	1
us	1
now	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
me	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
even	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
husband	1
that	1
should	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
you	1
will	1
kill	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
quinceys	1
but	1
was	1
low	1
and	1
strained	1
when	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
changed	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
i	1
die	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
live	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
thus	1
dead	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
without	1
a	1
moments	1
delay	1
drive	1
a	1
stake	1
through	1
me	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
head	1
or	1
do	1
whatever	1
else	1
may	1
be	1
wanting	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
rest	1
quincey	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
rise	1
after	1
the	1
pause	1
he	1
knelt	1
down	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
said	1
solemnly	1
im	1
only	1
a	1
rough	1
fellow	1
who	1
hasnt	1
perhaps	1
lived	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
to	1
win	1
such	1
a	1
distinction	1
but	1
i	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
i	1

sacred	1

that	1
should	1
the	1
time	1
ever	1
come	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
flinch	1
from	1
the	1
duty	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
set	1
us	1
and	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
too	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
make	1
all	1
certain	1
for	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
doubtful	1
i	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
time	1

my	1

in	1

kneeling	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
oath	1
i	1
followed	1
myself	1

her	1

turned	1
to	1
her	1
waneyed	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
greenish	1
pallor	1
which	1
subdued	1
the	1

of	1

sleeps	1
a	1

deal	1
throughout	1
the	1

she	1
slept	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
before	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
however	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
wakeful	1
and	1
alert	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
habit	1
for	1
van	1
helsing	1
to	1
hypnotise	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
at	1
first	1
some	1
effort	1
was	1
needed	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
many	1
passes	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
seems	1
to	1
yeild	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
habit	1
and	1
scarcely	1
any	1
action	1
is	1
needed	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
at	1
these	1
particular	1
moments	1
to	1
simply	1
will	1
and	1
her	1
thoughts	1
obey	1
him	1
he	1
always	1
asks	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
can	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
she	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
nothing	1
all	1
is	1
dark	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
i	1
can	1
hear	1
the	1
waves	1
lapping	1
against	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
rushing	1
by	1
canvas	1
and	1
cordage	1
strain	1
and	1
masts	1
and	1
yards	1

the	1
wind	1
is	1
high	1

and	1
the	1
bow	1
throws	1
back	1
the	1
foam	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
is	1
still	1
a	1
sea	1
hastening	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
varna	1
lord	1
godalming	1
has	1
just	1
returned	1
he	1
had	1
four	1
telegrams	1
one	1
each	1
day	1
since	1
we	1
started	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
reported	1
to	1
lloyds	1
from	1
anywhere	1
he	1
had	1
arranged	1
before	1
leaving	1
london	1
that	1
his	1
agent	1
should	1
send	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
telegram	1
saying	1
if	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
been	1
reported	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
message	1
even	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
not	1
reported	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
watch	1
being	1
kept	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
wire	1
we	1
had	1
dinner	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
early	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
vicecounsul	1
and	1
to	1
arrange	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
about	1
getting	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
arrives	1
van	1
helsing	1
says	1
that	1
our	1
chance	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
the	1
boat	1
between	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
the	1
count	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
takes	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
bat	1
cannot	1
cross	1
the	1
running	1
water	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
volition	1
and	1
so	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
change	1
to	1
mans	1
form	1
without	1
suspicion	1
which	1
he	1
evidently	1
washes	1
to	1
avoid	1
he	1
must	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
box	1
if	1
then	1
we	1
can	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
after	1
sunrise	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
our	1
mercy	1
for	1
we	1
can	1
open	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
make	1
sure	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
we	1
did	1
of	1
poor	1
lucy	1
before	1
he	1
wakes	1
what	1
mercy	1
he	1
shall	1
get	1
from	1
us	1
will	1
not	1
count	1
for	1
much	1
we	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
much	1
trouble	1
with	1
officials	1
or	1
the	1
seamen	1
thank	1
god	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
bibery	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
well	1
supplied	1
with	1
money	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
cannot	1
come	1
into	1
port	1
between	1
sunset	1
and	1
sunrise	1
without	1
our	1
being	1
warned	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
judge	1
moneybag	1
will	1
settle	1
this	1
case	1

same	1
lapping	1
waves	1
and	1
rushing	1
water	1
darkness	1
and	1
favouring	1
winds	1
we	1
are	1
evidently	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
as	1
she	1
must	1
pass	1
the	1
dardanelles	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
report	1
17	1
october	1
everything	1
is	1
pretty	1
well	1
fixed	1
now	1
i	1
think	1
to	1
welcome	1
the	1
count	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
tour	1
godalming	1
told	1
the	1
shippers	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
box	1
sent	1
aboard	1
might	1
contain	1
something	1
stolen	1
from	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
half	1
consent	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
open	1
it	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
risk	1
the	1
owner	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
paper	1
telling	1
the	1
captain	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
every	1
facility	1
in	1
doing	1
whatever	1
he	1
chose	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
similar	1
authorisation	1
to	1
his	1
agent	1
at	1
varna	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
agent	1
who	1
was	1
much	1
impressed	1
with	1
godalmings	1
kindly	1
manner	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
satisfied	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
aid	1
our	1
wishes	1

with	1

yesterday	1
when	1

got	1
his	1

what	1

the	1

to	1

is	1
heard	1
mrs	1
harker	1
alone	1
of	1
our	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
emotion	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
strange	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
we	1
took	1
special	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
any	1
excitement	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
she	1
would	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
have	1
noticed	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
it	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
she	1
is	1
greatly	1
changed	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
three	1
weeks	1
the	1
lethargy	1
grows	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
seems	1
strong	1
and	1
well	1
and	1
is	1
getting	1
back	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
colour	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
are	1
not	1
satisfied	1
we	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
often	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
however	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
it	1
would	1
break	1
poor	1
harkers	1
heart	1
certainly	1
his	1
nerve	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
suspicion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
van	1
helsing	1
examines	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
her	1
teeth	1
very	1
carefully	1
whilst	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hypnotic	1
condition	1
for	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
sharpen	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
active	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
if	1
this	1
change	1
should	1
come	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
steps	1
we	1
both	1
know	1
what	1
those	1
steps	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
though	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
mention	1
our	1
thoughts	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
we	1
should	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
shrink	1
from	1
the	1
task	1
awful	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
contemplate	1
euthanasia	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
and	1
a	1
comforting	1
word	1
i	1
am	1

about	1
24	1
hours	1

from	1
the	1
dardanelles	1
to	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
london	1
she	1
should	1
therefore	1
arrive	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
get	1
in	1
before	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
about	1
to	1
retire	1
early	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
up	1
at	1
one	1
oclock	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
25	1

noon	1
no	1

yet	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
arrival	1
mrs	1
harkers	1
hypnotic	1
report	1
this	1
morning	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
get	1
news	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
we	1
men	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
fever	1
of	1
excitement	1
except	1
harker	1
who	1
is	1
calm	1
his	1
hands	1
are	1
as	1
cold	1
as	1
ice	1
and	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
whetting	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
ghoorka	1
knife	1
which	1
he	1
now	1
always	1
carries	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
count	1
if	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
that	1
kukri	1
ever	1
touches	1
his	1
throat	1
driven	1
by	1
that	1
stern	1
icecold	1
hand	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
alarmed	1
about	1
mrs	1
harker	1
today	1
about	1
noon	1
she	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lethargy	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
although	1
we	1
kept	1
silence	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
we	1
were	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
happy	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
restless	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sleeping	1
when	1
however	1
her	1
husband	1
mentioned	1
casually	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sleeping	1
so	1
soundly	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
wake	1
her	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
ourselves	1
she	1
was	1
breathing	1
naturally	1
and	1
looked	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
peaceful	1
that	1
we	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
sleep	1
was	1
better	1
for	1
her	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
poor	1
girl	1
she	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
sleep	1
if	1
it	1
brings	1
oblivion	1
to	1
her	1
does	1
her	1
good	1
later	1
our	1
opinion	1
was	1
justified	1
for	1
when	1
after	1
a	1
refreshing	1
sleep	1
of	1
some	1
hours	1
she	1
woke	1
up	1
she	1
seemed	1
brighter	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
days	1
at	1
sunset	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
usual	1
hypnotic	1
report	1
wherever	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
black	1

movement	1
which	1
i	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
our	1
old	1
wandering	1
days	1
it	1
meant	1
action	1
mrs	1
harker	1
grew	1
ghastly	1
white	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
seemed	1
to	1
burn	1
but	1
she	1
folded	1
her	1
hands	1
meekly	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
prayer	1
harker	1
smiled	1
actually	1
smiled	1
the	1
dark	1
bitter	1
smile	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
without	1
hope	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
action	1
belied	1
his	1
words	1
for	1
his	1
hands	1
instinctively	1
sought	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
kukri	1
knife	1
and	1
rested	1
there	1
when	1
does	1
the	1
next	1
train	1
start	1
for	1
galatz	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
to	1
us	1
generally	1
at	1
630	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
we	1
all	1
stared	1
for	1
the	1
answer	1
came	1
from	1
mrs	1
harker	1
how	1
on	1
earth	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
said	1
art	1
you	1
forget	1
or	1
perhaps	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
though	1
jonathan	1
does	1
and	1
so	1
does	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
train	1
fiend	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
exeter	1
i	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
timetables	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
helpful	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
useful	1
sometimes	1
that	1
i	1
always	1
make	1
a	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
timetables	1
now	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
anything	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
us	1
to	1
castle	1
dracula	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
by	1
galatz	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
through	1
bucharest	1
so	1
i	1
learned	1
the	1
times	1
very	1
carefully	1
unhappily	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
to	1
learn	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
train	1
tomorrow	1
leaves	1
as	1
i	1
say	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
murmured	1
the	1
professor	1
cant	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
special	1
asked	1
lord	1
godalming	1
van	1
helsing	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
i	1
fear	1
not	1
this	1
land	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
yours	1
or	1
mine	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
did	1
have	1
a	1
special	1
it	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
arrive	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
our	1
regular	1
train	1
moreover	1
we	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
prepare	1
we	1
must	1
think	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
organize	1
you	1
friend	1
arthur	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
train	1
and	1
get	1
the	1
tickets	1
and	1
arrange	1
that	1
all	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
do	1
you	1

jonathan	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
agent	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
get	1
from	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
agent	1
in	1
galatz	1
with	1
authority	1
to	1
make	1
search	1
the	1
ship	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
morris	1
quincey	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
viceconsul	1
and	1
get	1
his	1
aid	1
with	1
his	1
fellow	1
in	1
galatz	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
make	1
our	1
way	1
smooth	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
times	1
be	1
lost	1
when	1
over	1
the	1
danube	1
john	1

stay	1
with	1
madam	1
mina	1
and	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
consult	1
for	1
so	1
if	1
time	1
be	1
long	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
delayed	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
matter	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
set	1
since	1
i	1
am	1
here	1
with	1
madam	1
to	1
make	1
report	1
and	1
i	1
said	1
mrs	1
harker	1
brightly	1
and	1
more	1
like	1
her	1
old	1
self	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
day	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
all	1
ways	1
and	1
shall	1
think	1
and	1
write	1
for	1
you	1
as	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
is	1
shifting	1
from	1
me	1
in	1
some	1
strange	1
way	1
and	1
i	1
feel	1
freer	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
three	1
younger	1
men	1
looked	1
happier	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
turning	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
met	1
each	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
troubled	1
glance	1
we	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
however	1
when	1
the	1
three	1
men	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
their	1
tasks	1
van	1
helsing	1
asked	1
mrs	1
harker	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
diaries	1
and	1
find	1
him	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
harkers	1
journal	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
upon	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
we	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
speak	1
out	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
change	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
sick	1
for	1
it	1
may	1
deceive	1
us	1
quite	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
i	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
manuscript	1
no	1
said	1
i	1
unless	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
me	1
alone	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
part	1
right	1
friend	1
john	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
part	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
and	1
oh	1
my	1
friend	1
i	1
am	1
taking	1
a	1
great	1
a	1
terrible	1
risk	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
madam	1
mina	1
said	1
those	1
words	1
that	1
arrest	1
both	1
our	1
understanding	1
an	1
inspiration	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
trance	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
ago	1
the	1
count	1
sent	1
her	1
his	1
spirit	1
to	1
read	1
her	1
mind	1
or	1
more	1
like	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
earthbox	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
water	1
rushing	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
go	1
free	1
at	1
rise	1
and	1
set	1
of	1
sun	1
he	1
learn	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
here	1
for	1
she	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
in	1
her	1
open	1
life	1
with	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
ears	1
to	1
hear	1
than	1
he	1
shut	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
coffinbox	1
now	1
he	1
make	1
his	1
most	1
effort	1
to	1
escape	1
us	1
at	1
present	1
he	1
want	1
her	1
not	1
he	1
is	1
sure	1
with	1
his	1
so	1
great	1
knowledge	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
at	1
his	1
call	1
but	1
he	1
cut	1
her	1
off	1
take	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
power	1
that	1
so	1
she	1
come	1
not	1
to	1
him	1
ah	1
there	1
i	1
have	1
hope	1
that	1
our	1
manbrains	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
man	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
lost	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
god	1
will	1
come	1
higher	1
than	1
his	1
childbrain	1
that	1
lie	1
in	1
his	1
tomb	1
for	1
centuries	1
that	1
grow	1
not	1
yet	1
to	1
our	1
stature	1
and	1
that	1
do	1
only	1
work	1
selfish	1
and	1
therefore	1
small	1
here	1
comes	1
madam	1
mina	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
trance	1
she	1
know	1
it	1
not	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
overwhelm	1
her	1
and	1
make	1
despair	1
just	1
when	1
we	1
want	1
all	1
her	1
hope	1
all	1
her	1
courage	1
when	1
most	1
we	1
want	1
all	1
her	1
great	1
brain	1
which	1
is	1
trained	1
like	1
mans	1
brain	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
sweet	1
woman	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
special	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
give	1
her	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
take	1
away	1
altogether	1
though	1
he	1
think	1
not	1
so	1
hush	1
let	1
me	1
speak	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
learn	1
oh	1
john	1
my	1
friend	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
awful	1
straits	1
i	1
fear	1
as	1
i	1
never	1
feared	1
before	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
trust	1
the	1
good	1
god	1
silence	1
here	1
she	1
comes	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
professor	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
break	1
down	1
and	1
have	1
hysterics	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
when	1
lucy	1
died	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
he	1
controlled	1
himself	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
perfect	1
nervous	1
poise	1
when	1
mrs	1
harker	1
tripped	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
bright	1
and	1
happylooking	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
work	1
seemingly	1
forgetful	1
of	1
her	1
misery	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
handed	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
sheets	1
of	1
typewriting	1
to	1
van	1
helsing	1
he	1
looked	1
over	1
them	1
gravely	1
his	1
face	1
brightening	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
then	1
holding	1
the	1
pages	1
between	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb	1
he	1
said	1
friend	1
john	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
experience	1
already	1
and	1
you	1
too	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
that	1
are	1
young	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
lesson	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
ever	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
halfthought	1
has	1
been	1
buzzing	1
often	1
in	1
my	1
brain	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
loose	1
his	1
wings	1
here	1
now	1
with	1
more	1
knowledge	1
i	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
that	1
halfthought	1
come	1
from	1
and	1
i	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
no	1
halfthought	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
a	1
whole	1
thought	1
though	1
so	1
young	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
strong	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
little	1
wings	1
nay	1
like	1
the	1
ugly	1
duck	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
hans	1
andersen	1
he	1
be	1
no	1
duckthought	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
big	1
swanthought	1
that	1
sail	1
nobly	1
on	1
big	1
wings	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
see	1
i	1
read	1
here	1
what	1
jonathan	1
have	1
written	1
that	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
race	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
later	1
age	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
brought	1
his	1
forces	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
into	1
turkey	1
land	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
beaten	1
back	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
come	1
alone	1
from	1
the	1
bloody	1
field	1
where	1
his	1
troops	1
were	1
being	1
slaughtered	1
since	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
ultimately	1
triumph	1
what	1
does	1
this	1
tell	1
us	1
not	1
much	1
no	1
the	1
counts	1
childthought	1
see	1
nothing	1
therefore	1
he	1
speak	1
so	1
free	1
your	1
manthought	1
see	1
nothing	1
my	1
manthought	1
see	1
nothing	1
till	1
just	1
now	1
no	1
but	1
there	1
comes	1
another	1
word	1
from	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
speak	1
without	1
thought	1
because	1
she	1
too	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
mean	1
what	1
it	1
might	1
mean	1
just	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
elements	1
which	1
rest	1
yet	1
when	1
in	1
natures	1
course	1
they	1
move	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
and	1
they	1
touch	1
then	1
pouf	1
and	1
there	1
comes	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
light	1
heaven	1
wide	1
that	1
blind	1
and	1
kill	1

when	1
in	1
what	1
mr	1

would	1
call	1
a	1
tight	1
place	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
country	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
invade	1
and	1
thence	1
without	1
losing	1
purpose	1
prepared	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
effort	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
better	1
equipped	1
for	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
won	1
so	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
london	1
to	1
invade	1
a	1
new	1
land	1
he	1
was	1
beaten	1
and	1
when	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
success	1
was	1
lost	1
and	1
his	1
existence	1
in	1
danger	1
he	1
fled	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
his	1
home	1
just	1
as	1
formerly	1
he	1
had	1
fled	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
danube	1
from	1
turkey	1
land	1
good	1
good	1
oh	1
you	1
so	1
clever	1
lady	1
said	1
van	1
helsing	1
enthusiastically	1
as	1
he	1
stooped	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
having	1
a	1
sickroom	1
consultation	1
seventytwo	1
only	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
excitement	1
i	1
have	1
hope	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
keen	1
expectation	1
but	1
go	1
on	1
go	1
on	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
john	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
do	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
and	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
speak	1
without	1
fear	1
i	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
seem	1
egotistical	1
nay	1
fear	1
not	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
egotist	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
we	1
think	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
criminal	1
he	1
is	1
selfish	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
intellect	1
is	1
small	1
and	1
his	1
action	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
selfishness	1
he	1
confines	1
himself	1
to	1
one	1
purpose	1
that	1
purpose	1
is	1
remorseless	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
danube	1
leaving	1
his	1
forces	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
to	1
pieces	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
intent	1
on	1
being	1
safe	1
careless	1
of	1
all	1
so	1
his	1
own	1
selfishness	1
frees	1
my	1
soul	1
somewhat	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
power	1
which	1
he	1
acquired	1
over	1
me	1
on	1
that	1
dreadful	1
night	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
oh	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
thank	1
god	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
mercy	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
freer	1
than	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
since	1
that	1
awful	1
hour	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
haunts	1
me	1
is	1
a	1
fear	1
lest	1
in	1
some	1
trance	1
or	1
dream	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
used	1
my	1
knowledge	1
for	1
his	1
ends	1
the	1
professor	1
stood	1
up	1
he	1
has	1
so	1
used	1
your	1
mind	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
here	1
in	1
varna	1
whilst	1
the	1
ship	1
that	1
carried	1
him	1
rushed	1
through	1
enveloping	1
fog	1
up	1
to	1
galatz	1
where	1
doubtless	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
preparation	1
for	1
escaping	1
from	1
us	1
but	1
his	1
childmind	1
only	1
saw	1
so	1
far	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
as	1
ever	1
is	1
in	1
gods	1
providence	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
evildoer	1
most	1
reckoned	1
on	1
for	1
his	1
selfish	1
good	1
turns	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
chiefest	1
harm	1
the	1
hunter	1
is	1
taken	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
snare	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
psalmist	1
says	1
for	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
every	1
trace	1
of	1
us	1
all	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
escaped	1
us	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
his	1
selfish	1
childbrain	1
will	1
whisper	1
him	1
to	1
sleep	1
he	1
think	1
too	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
cut	1
himself	1
off	1
from	1
knowing	1
your	1
mind	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
where	1
he	1
fall	1
that	1
terrible	1
baptism	1
of	1
blood	1
which	1
he	1
give	1
you	1
makes	1
you	1
free	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
spirit	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
as	1
yet	1
done	1
in	1
your	1
times	1
of	1
freedom	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
rise	1
and	1
set	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
you	1
go	1
by	1
my	1
volition	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
and	1
this	1
power	1
to	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
others	1
you	1
have	1
won	1
from	1
your	1
suffering	1
at	1
his	1
hands	1
this	1
is	1
now	1
all	1
more	1
precious	1
that	1
he	1
know	1
it	1
not	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
himself	1
have	1
even	1
cut	1
himself	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
where	1
we	1
however	1
are	1
not	1
selfish	1
and	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
god	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
blackness	1
and	1
these	1
many	1
dark	1
hours	1
we	1
shall	1
follow	1
him	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
flinch	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
peril	1
ourselves	1
that	1
we	1
become	1
like	1
him	1
friend	1
john	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
hour	1
and	1
it	1
have	1
done	1
much	1
to	1
advance	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
scribe	1
and	1
write	1
him	1
all	1
down	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
return	1
from	1
their	1
work	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
them	1
then	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
whilst	1
we	1
wait	1
their	1
return	1
and	1

in	1
the	1
train	1
from	1

to	1
galatz	1
last	1
night	1
we	1
all	1
assembled	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
sunset	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
work	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
thought	1
and	1
endeavour	1
and	1
opportunity	1
go	1
we	1
are	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
our	1
journey	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
work	1
when	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
galatz	1
when	1
the	1
usual	1
time	1
came	1
round	1
mrs	1
harker	1
prepared	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
hypnotic	1
effort	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
longer	1
and	1
more	1
serious	1
effort	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
van	1

than	1
has	1
been	1
usually	1
necessary	1
she	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
trance	1
usually	1
she	1
speaks	1
on	1
a	1
hint	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
questions	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
pretty	1
resolutely	1
before	1
we	1
could	1
learn	1
anything	1
at	1
last	1
her	1
answer	1
came	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
nothing	1
we	1
are	1
still	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
waves	1
lapping	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
steady	1
swirl	1
of	1
water	1
softly	1
running	1
against	1
the	1
hawser	1
i	1
can	1
hear	1
mens	1
voices	1
calling	1
near	1
and	1
far	1
and	1
the	1
roll	1
and	1
creak	1
of	1
oars	1
in	1
the	1
rowlocks	1
a	1
gun	1
is	1
fired	1
somewhere	1
the	1

far	1
away	1

of	1
light	1
i	1
can	1
feel	1
the	1
air	1
blowing	1
upon	1
me	1
here	1
she	1
stopped	1
she	1
had	1
risen	1
as	1

impulsively	1
from	1
where	1
she	1
lay	1
on	1

instinctively	1
closed	1
round	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
pause	1
we	1
all	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
was	1
passing	1
but	1
we	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
suddenly	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
sweetly	1
would	1
none	1

you	1

a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
you	1
must	1
all	1
be	1
so	1
tired	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
make	1
her	1
happy	1
and	1
so	1
acquiesced	1
she	1
bustled	1
off	1
to	1
get	1
tea	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
van	1
helsing	1
said	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
friends	1
he	1
is	1
close	1
to	1
land	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
his	1

but	1
he	1
has	1
yet	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
shore	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
may	1
lie	1
hidden	1
somewhere	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
carried	1
on	1
shore	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
ship	1
do	1
not	1

it	1
he	1
cannot	1
achieve	1
the	1

in	1
such	1
case	1
he	1
can	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
change	1
his	1
form	1
and	1
can	1
jump	1
or	1
fly	1
on	1
shore	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
whitby	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
day	1
come	1
before	1
he	1
get	1
on	1

then	1
unless	1

he	1
cannot	1

and	1
if	1
he	1

then	1
the	1
customs	1

may	1
discover	1
what	1
the	1

contains	1
thus	1
in	1
fine	1
if	1
he	1
escape	1
not	1
on	1

tonight	1
or	1
before	1
dawn	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
lost	1
to	1
him	1
we	1
may	1
then	1
arrive	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
escape	1
not	1
at	1
night	1
we	1
shall	1
come	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
daytime	1
boxed	1
up	1
and	1
at	1
our	1
mercy	1
for	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
true	1
self	1
awake	1
and	1
visible	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
discovered	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
so	1
we	1
waited	1
in	1
patience	1
until	1
the	1
dawn	1
at	1
which	1
time	1
we	1
might	1
learn	1
more	1
from	1
mrs	1
harker	1
early	1
this	1
morning	1
we	1
listened	1
with	1
breathless	1
anxiety	1
for	1
her	1
response	1
in	1
her	1
trance	1
the	1
hypnotic	1
stage	1
was	1
even	1
longer	1
in	1
coming	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
the	1
time	1
remaining	1
until	1
full	1
sunrise	1
was	1
so	1
short	1
that	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
despair	1
van	1
helsing	1
seemed	1
to	1
throw	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
into	1
the	1
effort	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
she	1
made	1
reply	1
all	1
is	1
dark	1
i	1
hear	1
lapping	1
water	1
level	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
some	1
creaking	1
as	1
of	1
wood	1
on	1
wood	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
sun	1
shot	1
up	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
till	1
tonight	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
travelling	1
towards	1
galatz	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
expectation	1
we	1
are	1
due	1
to	1
arrive	1
between	1
two	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
already	1
at	1
bucharest	1
we	1
are	1
three	1
hours	1
late	1
so	1
we	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
get	1
in	1
till	1
well	1
after	1
sunup	1
thus	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
two	1
more	1
hypnotic	1
messages	1
from	1
mrs	1
harker	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
may	1
possibly	1
throw	1
more	1
light	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
happening	1
later	1
sunset	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
gone	1
fortunately	1
it	1
came	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
distraction	1
for	1
had	1
it	1
occurred	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
a	1
station	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
secured	1
the	1
necessary	1
calm	1
and	1
isolation	1
mrs	1
harker	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
hypnotic	1
influence	1
even	1
less	1
readily	1
than	1
this	1
morning	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
fear	1
that	1
her	1
power	1
of	1
reading	1
the	1
counts	1
sensations	1
may	1
die	1
away	1
just	1
when	1
we	1
want	1
it	1
most	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
her	1
imagination	1
is	1
beginning	1
to	1
work	1
whilst	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
trance	1
hitherto	1
she	1
has	1
confined	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
simplest	1
of	1
facts	1
if	1
this	1
goes	1
on	1
it	1
may	1
ultimately	1
mislead	1
us	1
if	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
counts	1
power	1
over	1
her	1
would	1
die	1
away	1
equally	1
with	1
her	1
power	1
of	1
knowledge	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
happy	1
thought	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
speak	1
her	1

were	1
enigmatical	1
something	1

it	1

talking	1

strange	1

fierce	1
falling	1

and	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1

she	1
stopped	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
through	1
her	1
increasing	1
in	1
intensity	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
till	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
she	1
shook	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
palsy	1
she	1
said	1

together	1
with	1
the	1

between	1
ten	1

eleven	1
oclock	1
last	1
night	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
a	1
standstill	1
again	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
one	1
came	1
running	1
and	1
breathlessly	1
gasped	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
skinsky	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
inside	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
the	1

open	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
some	1
wild	1
animal	1
those	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
with	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1

the	1

crying	1
out	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
slovak	1
we	1
hurried	1
away	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
affair	1
and	1
so	1
detained	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
home	1
we	1
could	1
arrive	1
at	1
no	1
definite	1
conclusion	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
by	1
water	1
to	1
somewhere	1
but	1
where	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
discover	1
with	1
heavy	1
hearts	1
we	1
came	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
hotel	1
to	1
mina	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
together	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
consult	1
as	1
to	1
taking	1
mina	1
again	1
into	1
our	1
confidence	1
things	1
are	1
getting	1
desperate	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
chance	1
though	1
a	1
hazardous	1
one	1
as	1
a	1
preliminary	1
step	1

was	1

evening	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
tired	1
and	1
worn	1
out	1
and	1
dispirited	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
some	1
rest	1
so	1
i	1
asked	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
whilst	1
i	1
should	1
enter	1
everything	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
feel	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
invented	1
the	1
travellers	1
typewriter	1
and	1
to	1
mr	1
morris	1
for	1
getting	1
this	1
one	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
felt	1
quite	1
astray	1
doing	1
the	1
work	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
write	1

lies	1
on	1

hardly	1
seeming	1
to	1

his	1
whole	1

appears	1
in	1
collapse	1
his	1
brows	1
are	1
knit	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
drawn	1
with	1
pain	1
poor	1
fellow	1
maybe	1
he	1
is	1
thinking	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
all	1
wrinkled	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
concentration	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1

if	1
i	1

only	1

at	1
all	1
i	1

all	1
the	1

that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1

i	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
carefully	1
and	1
perhaps	1
i	1
may	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
conclusion	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
professors	1

without	1

be	1
fatal	1

he	1
might	1

what	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
if	1
left	1

place	1
with	1
no	1
refuge	1
that	1
he	1

not	1

by	1

here	1
is	1
the	1

way	1
in	1
one	1
respect	1
but	1
with	1
most	1
danger	1
in	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
he	1
is	1
powerless	1
except	1
at	1
night	1
even	1
then	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
summon	1
fog	1
and	1
storm	1
and	1
snow	1
and	1
his	1
wolves	1
but	1
were	1
he	1
wrecked	1
the	1
living	1
water	1
would	1
engulf	1
him	1
helpless	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
lost	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
vessel	1
drive	1
to	1
land	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
unfriendly	1
land	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
free	1
to	1
move	1
his	1
position	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
desperate	1
we	1
know	1
from	1
the	1
record	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
so	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
ascertain	1
what	1
water	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
realise	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
as	1
yet	1
we	1
may	1
then	1
get	1
a	1
light	1
on	1
what	1
his	1
later	1
task	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
firstly	1
we	1
must	1
differentiate	1
between	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
london	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
plan	1
of	1
action	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
pressed	1
for	1
moments	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
arrange	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
secondly	1
we	1
must	1
see	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
surmise	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
facts	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
here	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
evidently	1
intended	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
galatz	1
and	1
sent	1
invoice	1
to	1
varna	1
to	1
deceive	1
us	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
ascertain	1
his	1
means	1
of	1
exit	1
from	1
england	1
his	1
immediate	1
and	1
sole	1
purpose	1
then	1
was	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
letter	1
of	1
instructions	1
sent	1
to	1
immanuel	1
hildesheim	1
to	1
clear	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
box	1
before	1
sunrise	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
instruction	1
to	1
petrof	1
skinsky	1
these	1
we	1
must	1
only	1
guess	1
at	1
but	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
letter	1
or	1
message	1
since	1
skinsky	1
came	1
to	1
hildesheim	1
that	1
so	1
far	1
his	1
plans	1
were	1
successful	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
czarina	1
catherine	1
made	1
a	1
phenomenally	1
quick	1
journey	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
captain	1
donelsons	1
suspicions	1
were	1
aroused	1
but	1
his	1
superstition	1
united	1
with	1
his	1
canniness	1
played	1
the	1
counts	1
game	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
his	1
favouring	1
wind	1
through	1
fogs	1
and	1
all	1
till	1
he	1
brought	1
up	1
blindfold	1
at	1
galatz	1
that	1
the	1
counts	1
arrangements	1
were	1
well	1
made	1
has	1
been	1
proved	1
hildesheim	1
cleared	1
the	1
box	1
took	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
skinsky	1
skinsky	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
here	1
we	1
lose	1
the	1
trail	1
we	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
box	1
is	1
somewhere	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
moving	1
along	1
the	1
customs	1
and	1
the	1
octroi	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
have	1
been	1
avoided	1
now	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
count	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
on	1
land	1
at	1
galatz	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
skinsky	1
before	1
sunrise	1
at	1
sunrise	1
the	1
count	1
could	1
appear	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
form	1
here	1
we	1
ask	1
why	1
skinsky	1
was	1
chosen	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
aid	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
my	1
husbands	1
diary	1
skinsky	1
is	1
mentioned	1
as	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
slovaks	1
who	1
trade	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
the	1
port	1
and	1
the	1
mans	1
remark	1
that	1
the	1
murder	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
slovak	1
showed	1
the	1
general	1
feeling	1
against	1
his	1
class	1
the	1
count	1
wanted	1
isolation	1
my	1
surmise	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
in	1
london	1
the	1
count	1
decided	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
castle	1
by	1
water	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
safe	1
and	1
secret	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
castle	1
by	1
szgany	1
and	1
probably	1
they	1
delivered	1
their	1
cargo	1
to	1
slovaks	1
who	1
took	1
the	1
boxes	1
to	1
varna	1
for	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
shipped	1
for	1
london	1
thus	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
could	1
arrange	1
this	1
service	1
when	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
on	1
land	1
before	1
sunrise	1
or	1
after	1
sunset	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
box	1
met	1
skinsky	1
and	1
instructed	1
him	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
to	1
arranging	1
the	1
carriage	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
up	1
some	1
river	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
train	1
he	1
blotted	1
out	1
his	1
traces	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
by	1
murdering	1
his	1
agent	1
i	1
have	1
examined	1
the	1
map	1
and	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
river	1
most	1
suitable	1
for	1
the	1
slovaks	1
to	1
have	1
ascended	1
is	1
either	1
the	1
pruth	1
or	1
the	1
sereth	1
i	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
typescript	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
trance	1
i	1
heard	1
cows	1
low	1
and	1
water	1
swirling	1
level	1
with	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
wood	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
his	1
box	1
then	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
river	1
in	1
an	1
open	1
boat	1
propelled	1
probably	1
either	1
by	1
oars	1
or	1
poles	1
for	1
the	1
banks	1
are	1
near	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
working	1
against	1
stream	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
such	1
sound	1
if	1
floating	1
down	1
stream	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
either	1
the	1
sereth	1
or	1
the	1
pruth	1
but	1
we	1
may	1
possibly	1
investigate	1
further	1
now	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
the	1
pruth	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
navigated	1
but	1
the	1
sereth	1
is	1
at	1

by	1
the	1

up	1
round	1

this	1

to	1
you	1

at	1

not	1
for	1
heaven	1

hell	1
he	1
became	1
almost	1
speechless	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
that	1
awful	1
den	1
of	1
hellish	1
infamy	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
moonlight	1
alive	1
with	1
grisly	1
shapes	1
and	1
every	1
speck	1
of	1
dust	1
that	1
whirls	1
in	1
the	1

a	1

you	1
felt	1
the	1

upon	1

he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
lit	1
on	1
my	1
forehead	1
he	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
oh	1
my	1
god	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
done	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
terror	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
sank	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
collapse	1
of	1
misery	1
the	1
professors	1
voice	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
clear	1
sweet	1
tones	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
vibrate	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
calmed	1
us	1
all	1
oh	1
my	1
friend	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
i	1
would	1
save	1
madam	1
mina	1
from	1
that	1
awful	1
place	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
go	1
god	1
forbid	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
take	1
her	1
into	1
that	1
place	1
there	1
is	1
work	1
wild	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
there	1
that	1

eyes	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
we	1
men	1
here	1
all	1
save	1
jonathan	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
before	1
that	1

can	1
be	1
purify	1
remember	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
terrible	1
straits	1
if	1
the	1
count	1
escape	1
us	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
and	1
subtle	1
and	1
cunning	1
he	1
may	1
choose	1
to	1
sleep	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
century	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
time	1
our	1
dear	1
one	1
he	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
company	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
those	1
others	1
that	1
you	1
jonathan	1
saw	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
their	1
gloating	1
lips	1
you	1
heard	1
their	1
ribald	1
laugh	1
as	1
they	1
clutched	1
the	1
moving	1
bag	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
threw	1
to	1
them	1
you	1
shudder	1
and	1
well	1
may	1
it	1
be	1
forgive	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
pain	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
my	1
friend	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
dire	1
need	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
giving	1
possibly	1
my	1
life	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
anyone	1
went	1
into	1
that	1
place	1
to	1
stay	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
company	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
said	1
jonathan	1
with	1
a	1
sob	1
that	1
shook	1
him	1
all	1
over	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
god	1
later	1
oh	1
it	1
did	1
me	1
good	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
these	1
brave	1
men	1
worked	1
how	1
can	1
women	1
help	1
loving	1
men	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
earnest	1
and	1
so	1
true	1
and	1
so	1
brave	1
and	1
too	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
wonderful	1
power	1
of	1
money	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
not	1
do	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
properly	1
applied	1
and	1
what	1
might	1
it	1
do	1
when	1
basely	1
used	1
i	1
felt	1
so	1
thankful	1
that	1
lord	1
godalming	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
who	1
also	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
money	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
spend	1
it	1
so	1
freely	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
our	1
little	1

we	1

we	1

wrong	1
in	1
our	1

our	1
chance	1
is	1
gone	1
we	1
have	1
overhauled	1
every	1
boat	1
big	1
and	1
little	1
early	1
this	1
morning	1
one	1
crew	1
took	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
government	1
boat	1
and	1
treated	1
us	1
accordingly	1
we	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
smoothing	1
matters	1
so	1
at	1
fundu	1
where	1
the	1
bistritza	1
runs	1
into	1
the	1
sereth	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
roumanian	1
flag	1
which	1
we	1
now	1
fly	1
conspicuously	1
with	1
every	1
boat	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
overhauled	1
since	1
then	1
this	1
trick	1
has	1
succeeded	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
every	1
deference	1
shown	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
not	1
once	1
any	1
objection	1
to	1
whatever	1
we	1
chose	1
to	1
ask	1
or	1
do	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
slovaks	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
a	1
big	1
boat	1
passed	1
them	1
going	1
at	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
speed	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
double	1
crew	1
on	1
board	1
this	1
was	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
fundu	1
so	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
the	1
boat	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
bistritza	1
or	1
continued	1
on	1
up	1
the	1
sereth	1
at	1
fundu	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
boat	1
so	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
passed	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
am	1
feeling	1
very	1
sleepy	1
the	1
cold	1
is	1
perhaps	1
beginning	1
to	1
tell	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
nature	1
must	1
have	1
rest	1
some	1

him	1

2	1
november	1
morning	1
it	1
is	1
broad	1
daylight	1
that	1
good	1
fellow	1
would	1
not	1
wake	1
me	1
he	1
says	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
for	1
i	1
slept	1
so	1
peacefully	1
and	1
was	1
forgetting	1
my	1
trouble	1
it	1
seems	1
brutally	1
selfish	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
slept	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
watch	1
all	1
night	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
new	1
man	1
this	1
morning	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
sit	1
here	1
and	1
watch	1
him	1
sleeping	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
necessary	1
both	1
as	1
to	1
minding	1
the	1
engine	1
steering	1
and	1
keeping	1
watch	1
i	1
can	1
feel	1
that	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
energy	1
are	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
wonder	1
where	1
mina	1
is	1
now	1
and	1

they	1
should	1
have	1
got	1
to	1

about	1
noon	1
on	1

it	1
would	1
take	1
them	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
so	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
started	1
and	1
travelled	1
hard	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
about	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
god	1
guide	1
and	1

them	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
may	1
happen	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
go	1
faster	1
but	1
we	1
cannot	1
the	1
engines	1
are	1
throbbing	1
and	1
doing	1
their	1
utmost	1
i	1
wonder	1
how	1
dr	1
seward	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
are	1
getting	1
on	1
there	1

as	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
very	1
large	1
at	1
present	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
terrible	1
doubtless	1
in	1
winter	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
snow	1
melts	1
the	1

may	1
not	1
have	1
met	1
much	1

that	1
before	1

to	1

we	1
may	1
see	1

by	1
that	1

we	1
have	1
not	1

we	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1

having	1
been	1
detained	1
by	1
an	1
accident	1
when	1
trying	1
to	1

a	1

up	1
the	1

the	1

boats	1
get	1
up	1
all	1
right	1
by	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
rope	1
and	1
steering	1
with	1
knowledge	1
some	1
went	1
up	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before	1
godalming	1
is	1
an	1
amateur	1
fitter	1
himself	1
and	1
evidently	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
put	1
the	1
launch	1
in	1
trim	1
again	1
finally	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
the	1

all	1
right	1
with	1
local	1
help	1
and	1
are	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
chase	1
afresh	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
better	1
for	1
the	1
accident	1
the	1
peasantry	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
after	1
she	1
got	1
upon	1

again	1
she	1
kept	1

again	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
was	1

arrived	1
at	1
veresti	1
at	1
noon	1
the	1
professor	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
morning	1
at	1
dawn	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
hypnotise	1
me	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
i	1
could	1
say	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
quiet	1
he	1
is	1
off	1
now	1
buying	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
horses	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
later	1
on	1
try	1
to	1
buy	1
additional	1
horses	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
change	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
we	1
have	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
70	1
miles	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
lovely	1
and	1
most	1
interesting	1
if	1
only	1
we	1
were	1
under	1
different	1
conditions	1
how	1
delightful	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
if	1
jonathan	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
driving	1
through	1
it	1
alone	1
what	1
a	1
pleasure	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
see	1
people	1
and	1
learn	1
something	1
of	1
their	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
fill	1
our	1
minds	1

the	1

of	1

qualities	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
very	1
superstitious	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
house	1
where	1
we	1
stopped	1

the	1

who	1

us	1
saw	1
the	1
scar	1
on	1
my	1

she	1
crossed	1
herself	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
two	1
fingers	1
towards	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
off	1
the	1
evil	1

believe	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
putting	1
an	1
extra	1
amount	1
of	1
garlic	1
into	1
our	1

i	1
cant	1
abide	1
garlic	1
ever	1
since	1

i	1
have	1
taken	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
hat	1
or	1
veil	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
escaped	1
their	1
suspicions	1
we	1
are	1
travelling	1
fast	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
no	1

with	1
us	1
to	1
carry	1
tales	1
we	1
go	1
ahead	1
of	1
scandal	1
but	1
i	1
daresay	1
that	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
eye	1
will	1
follow	1
hard	1
behind	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
professor	1
seems	1
tireless	1
all	1
day	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
rest	1
though	1
he	1
made	1
me	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
spell	1
at	1
sunset	1
time	1
he	1
hypnotised	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
i	1
answered	1
as	1
usual	1
darkness	1
lapping	1
water	1
and	1
creaking	1
wood	1
so	1
our	1
enemy	1
is	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
to	1

jonathan	1

somehow	1
i	1
have	1
now	1
no	1

for	1
him	1
or	1
for	1
myself	1

old	1
and	1
grey	1
but	1
his	1
mouth	1
is	1
set	1
as	1
firmly	1
as	1
a	1
conquerors	1
even	1
in	1
his	1

he	1
is	1
instinct	1
with	1
resolution	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
well	1
started	1
i	1
must	1
make	1
him	1
rest	1
whilst	1
i	1
drive	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
days	1
before	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
break	1
down	1
when	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
will	1
be	1
needed	1
all	1
is	1

are	1
off	1

was	1

now	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
on	1
us	1
bright	1
though	1
cold	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
heaviness	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
i	1
say	1
heaviness	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
word	1
i	1
mean	1
that	1
it	1
oppresses	1
us	1
both	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
cold	1
and	1
only	1
our	1
warm	1
furs	1
keep	1
us	1
comfortable	1
at	1

he	1
says	1
i	1
answered	1
darkness	1
creaking	1
wood	1
and	1
roaring	1
water	1
so	1
the	1
river	1
is	1
changing	1
as	1
they	1
ascend	1
i	1
do	1
hope	1
that	1
my	1
darling	1
will	1
not	1
run	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
danger	1
more	1
than	1

be	1

november	1
night	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
driving	1
the	1
country	1
gets	1
wilder	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
spurs	1
of	1
the	1
carpathians	1
which	1
at	1
veresti	1
seemed	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
so	1
low	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
now	1
seem	1
to	1
gather	1
round	1
us	1
and	1
tower	1
in	1
front	1
we	1
both	1
seem	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
i	1
think	1
we	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
each	1
to	1
cheer	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1

we	1
cheer	1
ourselves	1
dr	1

helsing	1
says	1
that	1
by	1
morning	1
we	1
shall	1
reach	1
the	1
borgo	1
pass	1
the	1
houses	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
here	1
now	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
horses	1
we	1
got	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
change	1
he	1
got	1
two	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
we	1
changed	1
so	1
that	1
now	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
rude	1
fourinhand	1
the	1
dear	1
horses	1
are	1
patient	1
and	1
good	1
and	1
they	1
give	1
us	1
no	1
trouble	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
worried	1
with	1
other	1
travellers	1
and	1
so	1
even	1
i	1
can	1
drive	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
pass	1
in	1
daylight	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
arrive	1
before	1

we	1
take	1
it	1
easy	1
and	1
have	1
each	1
a	1
long	1
rest	1
in	1
turn	1
oh	1
what	1

tomorrow	1
bring	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
my	1
poor	1

suffered	1
so	1
much	1
god	1
grant	1
that	1
we	1
may	1

think	1
somewhat	1
strange	1
but	1
soon	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
only	1
one	1
such	1
byroad	1
it	1
is	1
used	1
but	1
little	1
and	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
coach	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
bukovina	1
to	1
bistritz	1
which	1
is	1
more	1
wide	1
and	1
hard	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
use	1
so	1
we	1
came	1
down	1
this	1
road	1
when	1
we	1
meet	1
other	1
ways	1
not	1
always	1
were	1
we	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
were	1

they	1
only	1
i	1
give	1
rein	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
on	1
so	1
patient	1
byandby	1
we	1
find	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
jonathan	1
have	1
note	1
in	1
that	1
wonderful	1
diary	1
of	1
him	1
then	1

i	1
have	1
seen	1
some	1
strange	1
things	1
together	1
you	1
may	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
van	1

am	1
mad	1
that	1
the	1
many	1
horrors	1
and	1
the	1
so	1
long	1
strain	1
on	1
nerves	1
has	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
turn	1
my	1
brain	1
all	1
yesterday	1
we	1
travel	1
ever	1
getting	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
moving	1
into	1
a	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
wild	1
and	1
desert	1
land	1
there	1
are	1
great	1
frowning	1
precipices	1
and	1
much	1
falling	1
water	1
and	1
nature	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
held	1
sometime	1
her	1
carnival	1
madam	1
mina	1
still	1
sleep	1
and	1
sleep	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
did	1
have	1
hunger	1
and	1
appeased	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
waken	1
her	1
even	1
for	1
food	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
fatal	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
upon	1
her	1
tainted	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
with	1
that	1
vampire	1
baptism	1
well	1
said	1
i	1
to	1
myself	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
she	1
sleep	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
be	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
sleep	1
at	1
night	1
as	1
we	1
travel	1
on	1
the	1
rough	1
road	1
for	1
a	1
road	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
and	1
imperfect	1
kind	1
there	1
was	1
i	1
held	1
down	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
slept	1
again	1
i	1
waked	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
guilt	1
and	1
of	1
time	1
passed	1
and	1
found	1
madam	1
mina	1
still	1
sleeping	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
low	1
down	1
but	1
all	1
was	1
indeed	1
changed	1
the	1
frowning	1
mountains	1
seemed	1
further	1
away	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
near	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
steeprising	1
hill	1
on	1
summit	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
castle	1
as	1
jonathan	1
tell	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
diary	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
exulted	1
and	1
feared	1
for	1
now	1
for	1
good	1
or	1
ill	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
near	1
i	1
woke	1
madam	1
mina	1
and	1
again	1
tried	1
to	1
hypnotise	1
her	1
but	1
alas	1
unavailing	1
till	1
too	1
late	1
then	1
ere	1
the	1
great	1
dark	1
came	1
upon	1
us	1
for	1
even	1
after	1
downsun	1
the	1
heavens	1
reflected	1
the	1
gone	1
sun	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
twilight	1
i	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
fed	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
shelter	1
i	1
could	1
then	1
i	1
make	1
a	1
fire	1
and	1
near	1
it	1
i	1
make	1
madam	1
mina	1
now	1
awake	1
and	1
more	1
charming	1
than	1
ever	1
sit	1
comfortable	1
amid	1
her	1
rugs	1
i	1
got	1
ready	1
food	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
eat	1
simply	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
hunger	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
press	1
her	1
knowing	1
her	1
unavailingness	1
but	1
i	1
myself	1
eat	1
for	1
i	1
must	1
needs	1
now	1
be	1
strong	1
for	1
all	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
fear	1
on	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
i	1
drew	1
a	1
ring	1
so	1
big	1
for	1
her	1
comfort	1
round	1
where	1
madam	1
mina	1
sat	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
ring	1
i	1
passed	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wafer	1
and	1
i	1
broke	1
it	1
fine	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well	1
guarded	1
she	1
sat	1
still	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
so	1
still	1
as	1
one	1
dead	1
and	1
she	1
grew	1
whiter	1
and	1
ever	1
whiter	1
till	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
pale	1
and	1
no	1
word	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
drew	1
near	1
she	1
clung	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
soul	1
shook	1
her	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
tremor	1
that	1
was	1
pain	1
to	1
feel	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
presently	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
grown	1
more	1
quiet	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
for	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
test	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
rose	1
obedient	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
stood	1
as	1
one	1
stricken	1
why	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
i	1
asked	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
coming	1
back	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
then	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
open	1
eyes	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
waked	1
from	1
sleep	1
she	1
said	1
simply	1
i	1
cannot	1
and	1
remained	1
silent	1
i	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
we	1
dreaded	1
could	1
though	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
danger	1
to	1
her	1
body	1
yet	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
safe	1
presently	1
the	1
horses	1
began	1
to	1
scream	1
and	1
tore	1
at	1
their	1
tethers	1
till	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
quieted	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
feel	1
my	1
hands	1
on	1
them	1
they	1
whinnied	1
low	1
as	1
in	1
joy	1
and	1
licked	1
at	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
were	1
quiet	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
many	1
times	1
through	1
the	1
night	1
did	1
i	1
come	1
to	1
them	1
till	1
it	1
arrive	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
hour	1
when	1
all	1
nature	1
is	1
at	1
lowest	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
my	1
coming	1
was	1
with	1
quiet	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
hour	1
the	1
fire	1
began	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
stepping	1
forth	1
to	1
replenish	1
it	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
snow	1
came	1
in	1
flying	1
sweeps	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
a	1
chill	1
mist	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
as	1
there	1
ever	1
is	1
over	1
snow	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
snowflurries	1
and	1
the	1
wreaths	1
of	1
mist	1
took	1
shape	1
as	1
of	1
women	1
with	1
trailing	1
garments	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
dead	1
grim	1
silence	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
whinnied	1
and	1
cowered	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
worst	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
horrible	1
fears	1
but	1
then	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
safety	1
in	1
that	1
ring	1
wherein	1
i	1
stood	1
i	1
began	1
too	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
my	1
imaginings	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
gloom	1
and	1
the	1
unrest	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
terrible	1
anxiety	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
my	1
memories	1
of	1
all	1
jonathans	1
horrid	1
experience	1
were	1
befooling	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
snow	1
flakes	1
and	1
the	1
mist	1
began	1
to	1
wheel	1
and	1
circle	1
round	1
till	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
shadowy	1
glimpse	1
of	1
those	1
women	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
horses	1
cowered	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
and	1
moaned	1
in	1
terror	1
as	1
men	1
do	1
in	1
pain	1
even	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
fright	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
break	1
away	1
i	1
feared	1
for	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
when	1
these	1
weird	1
figures	1
drew	1
near	1
and	1
circled	1
round	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
sat	1
calm	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
replenish	1
it	1
she	1
caught	1
me	1
and	1
held	1
me	1
back	1
and	1
whispered	1
like	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
one	1
hears	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
so	1
low	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
no	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
without	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
safe	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
but	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
fear	1
whereat	1
she	1
laughed	1
a	1
laugh	1
low	1
and	1
unreal	1
and	1
said	1
fear	1
for	1
me	1
why	1
fear	1
for	1
me	1
none	1
safer	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
them	1
than	1
i	1
am	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
words	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
wind	1
made	1
the	1
flame	1
leap	1
up	1
and	1
i	1
see	1
the	1
red	1
scar	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
then	1
alas	1
i	1
knew	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
i	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
learned	1
for	1
the	1
wheeling	1
figures	1
of	1
mist	1
and	1
snow	1
came	1
closer	1
but	1
keeping	1
ever	1
without	1
the	1
holy	1
circle	1
then	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
materialise	1
till	1
if	1
god	1
have	1
not	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
reason	1
for	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
through	1
my	1
eyes	1
there	1
were	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
actual	1
flesh	1
the	1
same	1
three	1
women	1
that	1
jonathan	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
when	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
his	1
throat	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
swaying	1
round	1
forms	1
the	1
bright	1
hard	1
eyes	1
the	1
white	1
teeth	1
the	1
ruddy	1
colour	1
the	1
voluptuous	1
lips	1
they	1
smiled	1
ever	1
at	1
poor	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
and	1
as	1
their	1
laugh	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
twined	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
those	1
so	1
sweet	1
tingling	1
tones	1
that	1
jonathan	1
said	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
intolerable	1
sweetness	1
of	1
the	1
waterglasses	1
come	1
sister	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
come	1
come	1
in	1
fear	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
madam	1
mina	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
with	1
gladness	1
leapt	1
like	1
flame	1
for	1
oh	1
the	1
terror	1
in	1
her	1
sweet	1
eyes	1
the	1
repulsion	1
the	1
horror	1
told	1
a	1
story	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
of	1
hope	1
god	1
be	1
thanked	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
seized	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
firewood	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
me	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
wafer	1
advanced	1
on	1
them	1
towards	1
the	1
fire	1
they	1
drew	1
back	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
laughed	1
their	1
low	1
horrid	1
laugh	1
i	1
fed	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
feared	1
them	1
not	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
safe	1
within	1
our	1
protections	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
approach	1
me	1
whilst	1
so	1
armed	1
nor	1
madam	1
mina	1
whilst	1
she	1
remained	1
within	1
the	1
ring	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
could	1
enter	1
the	1
horses	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
moan	1
and	1
lay	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
the	1
snow	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
softly	1
and	1
they	1
grew	1
whiter	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
beasts	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
terror	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
remained	1
till	1
the	1
red	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
through	1
the	1
snowgloom	1
i	1
was	1
desolate	1
and	1
afraid	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
woe	1
and	1
terror	1
but	1
when	1
that	1
beautiful	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
climb	1
the	1
horizon	1
life	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
first	1

of	1

the	1

away	1

the	1

and	1
were	1
lost	1
instinctively	1
with	1
the	1
dawn	1
coming	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
madam	1

intending	1
to	1
hypnotise	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
sudden	1
sleep	1
from	1
which	1
i	1

made	1
no	1

left	1

sleeping	1
within	1
the	1

i	1
took	1
my	1

to	1
the	1

the	1
blacksmith	1
hammer	1
which	1
i	1

me	1
here	1
by	1

found	1
my	1

to	1
the	1

for	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
here	1
my	1

lay	1
the	1

was	1

it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
sulphurous	1
fume	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
made	1
me	1
dizzy	1
either	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
roaring	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
or	1
i	1
heard	1
afar	1
off	1
the	1
howl	1
of	1
wolves	1
then	1
i	1
bethought	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1

i	1
was	1
in	1

the	1

me	1
between	1
his	1

her	1
i	1

not	1

left	1

and	1
yet	1
even	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
the	1

me	1
that	1
my	1

lay	1
here	1

that	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
wolves	1
we	1
must	1
submit	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
gods	1
will	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
death	1
and	1
freedom	1
beyond	1
so	1
did	1
i	1
choose	1
for	1
her	1
had	1
it	1
but	1
been	1
for	1
myself	1
the	1
choice	1
had	1
been	1
easy	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
the	1
wolf	1
were	1
better	1
to	1
rest	1
in	1
than	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
the	1
vampire	1
so	1
i	1
make	1
my	1
choice	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
work	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
three	1
graves	1
to	1
find	1
graves	1
that	1
are	1
inhabit	1
so	1
i	1
search	1
and	1
search	1
and	1
i	1
find	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
she	1
lay	1
in	1
her	1
vampire	1
sleep	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
voluptuous	1
beauty	1
that	1
i	1
shudder	1
as	1
though	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
murder	1
ah	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
when	1
such	1
things	1
were	1
many	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
set	1
forth	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
task	1
as	1
mine	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
his	1
heart	1
fail	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
nerve	1
so	1
he	1
delay	1
and	1
delay	1
and	1
delay	1
till	1
the	1
mere	1
beauty	1
and	1
the	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
wanton	1
undead	1
have	1
hypnotise	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
remain	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
till	1
sunset	1
come	1
and	1
the	1
vampire	1
sleep	1
be	1
over	1
then	1
the	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
woman	1
open	1
and	1
look	1
love	1
and	1
the	1
voluptuous	1
mouth	1
present	1
to	1
a	1
kiss	1
and	1
man	1
is	1
weak	1
and	1
there	1
remain	1
one	1
more	1
victim	1
in	1
the	1
vampire	1
fold	1
one	1
more	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
grim	1
and	1
grisly	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
undead	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
fascination	1
surely	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
presence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
even	1
lying	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
tomb	1
fretted	1
with	1
age	1
and	1
heavy	1
with	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
centuries	1
though	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
horrid	1
odour	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
lairs	1
of	1
the	1

yes	1
i	1
was	1
moved	1
i	1
van	1

with	1
all	1
my	1
purpose	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
motive	1
for	1
hate	1
i	1
was	1
moved	1
to	1
a	1
yearning	1
for	1
delay	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
paralyse	1
my	1
faculties	1
and	1
to	1
clog	1
my	1
very	1
soul	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
natural	1
sleep	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
overcome	1
me	1
certain	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
lapsing	1
into	1
sleep	1
the	1
openeyed	1
sleep	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
yields	1
to	1
a	1
sweet	1
fascination	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
through	1
the	1

air	1
a	1
long	1
low	1
wail	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
woe	1
and	1
pity	1
that	1
it	1
woke	1
me	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
clarion	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
that	1
i	1
heard	1
then	1
i	1
braced	1
myself	1
again	1
to	1
my	1
horrid	1
task	1
and	1
found	1
by	1
wrenching	1
away	1
tombtops	1
one	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
sisters	1
the	1

not	1
pause	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
lest	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
should	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
enthrall	1
but	1
i	1
go	1
on	1
searching	1
until	1
presently	1
i	1
find	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
great	1
tomb	1
as	1
if	1
made	1
to	1
one	1
much	1
beloved	1
that	1
other	1
fair	1
sister	1
which	1
like	1
jonathan	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
to	1
gather	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
the	1
mist	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
so	1
radiantly	1
beautiful	1
so	1
exquisitely	1
voluptuous	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
instinct	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
me	1
which	1
calls	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
sex	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
protect	1
one	1
of	1
hers	1
made	1
my	1
head	1
whirl	1
with	1
new	1
emotion	1
but	1
god	1
be	1
thanked	1
that	1
soulwall	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
mina	1
had	1
not	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
spell	1
could	1
be	1
wrought	1
further	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
nerved	1
myself	1
to	1
my	1
wild	1
work	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
had	1
searched	1
all	1
the	1
tombs	1
in	1
the	1
chapel	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
tell	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
three	1
of	1
these	1
undead	1
phantoms	1
around	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
i	1

active	1

her	1

november	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
our	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
east	1
whence	1
i	1
knew	1
jonathan	1
was	1
coming	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
fast	1
though	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
steeply	1
downhill	1
for	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
heavy	1
rugs	1
and	1
wraps	1
with	1
us	1
we	1
dared	1
not	1
face	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
without	1
warmth	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
provisions	1
too	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
desolation	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
snowfall	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
habitation	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
i	1
was	1
tired	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
walking	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
rest	1
then	1
we	1
looked	1
back	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
the	1
clear	1
line	1
of	1
draculas	1
castle	1
cut	1
the	1
sky	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
deep	1
under	1
the	1
hill	1
whereon	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
that	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
perspective	1
of	1
the	1
carpathian	1
mountains	1
was	1
far	1
below	1
it	1
we	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
grandeur	1
perched	1
a	1
thousand	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
a	1
sheer	1
precipice	1
and	1
with	1
seemingly	1
a	1
great	1
gap	1
between	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
steep	1
of	1
the	1
adjacent	1
mountain	1
on	1
any	1
side	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
wild	1
and	1
uncanny	1
about	1
the	1
place	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
distant	1
howling	1
of	1
wolves	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
but	1
the	1
sound	1
even	1
though	1
coming	1
muffled	1
through	1
the	1
deadening	1
snowfall	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
terror	1
i	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
was	1
searching	1
about	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
seek	1
some	1
strategic	1
point	1
where	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
exposed	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
attack	1
the	1
rough	1
roadway	1
still	1
led	1
downwards	1
we	1
could	1
trace	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
drifted	1
snow	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
the	1
professor	1
signalled	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
joined	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
wonderful	1
spot	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
natural	1
hollow	1
in	1
a	1
rock	1
with	1
an	1
entrance	1
like	1
a	1
doorway	1
between	1
two	1
boulders	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
drew	1
me	1
in	1
see	1
he	1
said	1
here	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
shelter	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
wolves	1
do	1
come	1
i	1
can	1
meet	1
them	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
our	1
furs	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
snug	1
nest	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
got	1
out	1
some	1
provisions	1
and	1
forced	1
them	1
upon	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
eat	1
to	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
was	1
repulsive	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
attempt	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
sad	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
me	1
taking	1
his	1
fieldglasses	1
from	1
the	1
case	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
horizon	1
suddenly	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
look	1
madam	1
mina	1
look	1
look	1
i	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
his	1
glasses	1
and	1
pointed	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
now	1
falling	1
more	1
heavily	1
and	1
swirled	1
about	1
fiercely	1
for	1
a	1
high	1
wind	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
blow	1
however	1
there	1
were	1
times	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
pauses	1
between	1
the	1
snow	1
flurries	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
round	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
and	1
far	1
off	1
beyond	1
the	1
white	1
waste	1
of	1
snow	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
river	1
lying	1
like	1
a	1
black	1
ribbon	1
in	1
kinks	1
and	1
curls	1
as	1
it	1
wound	1
its	1
way	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
in	1
fact	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
i	1
wondered	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
before	1
came	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
mounted	1
men	1
hurrying	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
cart	1
a	1
long	1
leiterwagon	1
which	1
swept	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
like	1
a	1
dogs	1
tail	1
wagging	1
with	1
each	1
stern	1
inequality	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
snow	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
mens	1
clothes	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
peasants	1
or	1
gypsies	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
on	1
the	1
cart	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
square	1
chest	1
my	1
heart	1
leaped	1
as	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
coming	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
now	1
drawing	1
close	1
and	1
well	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
at	1
sunset	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
till	1
then	1
imprisoned	1
there	1
would	1
take	1
new	1
freedom	1
and	1
could	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
many	1
forms	1
elude	1
all	1
pursuit	1
in	1
fear	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
to	1
my	1
consternation	1
however	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
an	1
instant	1
later	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
below	1
me	1
round	1
the	1
rock	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
a	1
circle	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
found	1
shelter	1
in	1
last	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
completed	1
it	1
he	1
stood	1
beside	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
here	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
glasses	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
lull	1
of	1
the	1
snow	1
swept	1
the	1
whole	1
space	1
below	1
us	1
see	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
come	1
quickly	1
they	1
are	1
flogging	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
galloping	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
voice	1
they	1
are	1
racing	1
for	1
the	1
sunset	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
gods	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
down	1
came	1
another	1
blinding	1
rush	1
of	1
driving	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
landscape	1
was	1
blotted	1
out	1
it	1
soon	1
passed	1
however	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
his	1
glasses	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
plain	1
then	1
came	1
a	1
sudden	1
cry	1
look	1
look	1
look	1
see	1
two	1
horsemen	1
follow	1
fast	1
coming	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
quincey	1
and	1
john	1
take	1
the	1
glass	1
look	1
before	1
the	1
snow	1
blots	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
and	1
looked	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
might	1
be	1
dr	1
seward	1
and	1
mr	1
morris	1
i	1
knew	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
jonathan	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
jonathan	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
looking	1
around	1
i	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
party	1
two	1
other	1
men	1
riding	1
at	1
breakneck	1
speed	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
knew	1
was	1
jonathan	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
i	1
took	1
of	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
lord	1
godalming	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
pursuing	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
cart	1
when	1
i	1
told	1
the	1
professor	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
glee	1
like	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
and	1
after	1
looking	1
intently	1
till	1
a	1
snow	1
fall	1
made	1
sight	1
impossible	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
winchester	1
rifle	1
ready	1
for	1
use	1
against	1
the	1
boulder	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
our	1
shelter	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
converging	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
gypsies	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
i	1
got	1
out	1
my	1
revolver	1
ready	1
to	1
hand	1
for	1
whilst	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
wolves	1
came	1
louder	1
and	1
closer	1
when	1
the	1
snow	1
storm	1
abated	1
a	1
moment	1
we	1
looked	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
snow	1
falling	1
in	1
such	1
heavy	1
flakes	1
close	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
beyond	1
the	1
sun	1
shining	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
brightly	1
as	1
it	1
sank	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
far	1
mountain	1
tops	1
sweeping	1
the	1
glass	1
all	1
around	1
us	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
dots	1
moving	1
singly	1
and	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
and	1
larger	1
numbers	1
the	1
wolves	1
were	1
gathering	1
for	1
their	1
prey	1
every	1
instant	1
seemed	1
an	1
age	1
whilst	1
we	1
waited	1
the	1
wind	1
came	1
now	1
in	1
fierce	1
bursts	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
driven	1
with	1
fury	1
as	1
it	1
swept	1
upon	1
us	1
in	1
circling	1
eddies	1
at	1
times	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
an	1
arms	1
length	1
before	1
us	1
but	1
at	1
others	1
as	1
the	1
hollowsounding	1
wind	1
swept	1
by	1
us	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
airspace	1
around	1
us	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
afar	1
off	1
we	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
that	1
we	1
knew	1
with	1
fair	1
accuracy	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
we	1
knew	1
that	1
before	1
long	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
set	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
by	1
our	1
watches	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
that	1
we	1
waited	1
in	1
that	1
rocky	1
shelter	1
before	1
the	1
various	1
bodies	1
began	1
to	1
converge	1
close	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
wind	1
came	1
now	1
with	1
fiercer	1
and	1
more	1
bitter	1
sweeps	1
and	1
more	1
steadily	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
it	1
seemingly	1
had	1
driven	1
the	1
snow	1
clouds	1
from	1
us	1
for	1
with	1
only	1
occasional	1
bursts	1
the	1
snow	1
fell	1
we	1
could	1
distinguish	1
clearly	1
the	1
individuals	1
of	1
each	1
party	1
the	1
pursued	1
and	1
the	1
pursuers	1
strangely	1
enough	1
those	1
pursued	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
realise	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
pursued	1
they	1
seemed	1
however	1
to	1
hasten	1
with	1
redoubled	1
speed	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
dropped	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
on	1
the	1
mountain	1
tops	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
they	1
drew	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
i	1
crouched	1
down	1
behind	1
our	1
rock	1
and	1
held	1
our	1
weapons	1
ready	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
pass	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
quite	1
unaware	1
of	1
our	1
presence	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
two	1
voices	1
shouted	1
out	1
to	1
halt	1
one	1

my	1
jonathans	1

in	1
a	1
high	1
key	1
of	1
passion	1
the	1
other	1
mr	1

strong	1
resolute	1
tone	1
of	1
quiet	1
command	1
the	1
gypsies	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
language	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
whatever	1
tongue	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
spoken	1
instinctively	1
they	1
reined	1
in	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
jonathan	1
dashed	1
up	1
at	1
one	1
side	1

and	1
mr	1

on	1
the	1

leader	1
of	1
the	1
gypsies	1
a	1
splendid	1
looking	1
fellow	1
who	1
sat	1
his	1
horse	1
like	1
a	1
centaur	1
waved	1
them	1
back	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
fierce	1
voice	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
companions	1
some	1
word	1
to	1
proceed	1
they	1
lashed	1
the	1
horses	1
which	1
sprang	1
forward	1
but	1
the	1
four	1
men	1
raised	1
their	1
winchester	1
rifles	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
way	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
dr	1
van	1
helsing	1
and	1
i	1
rose	1
behind	1
the	1
rock	1
and	1
pointed	1
our	1
weapons	1
at	1
them	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
the	1
men	1
tightened	1
their	1
reins	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
the	1
leader	1
turned	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
word	1
at	1
which	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
gypsy	1
party	1
drew	1
what	1

himself	1

in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
leader	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
movement	1
of	1

rein	1

out	1

to	1
the	1
sun	1
now	1
close	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
tops	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
said	1
something	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
for	1
answer	1
all	1
four	1
men	1
of	1
our	1
party	1
threw	1
themselves	1
from	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
dashed	1
towards	1
the	1
cart	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
felt	1
terrible	1
fear	1
at	1
seeing	1
jonathan	1
in	1
such	1
danger	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
ardour	1
of	1
battle	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
felt	1
no	1
fear	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
wild	1
surging	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
seeing	1
the	1
quick	1
movement	1
of	1
our	1
parties	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
gypsies	1
gave	1
a	1
command	1
his	1
men	1
instantly	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
cart	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
undisciplined	1
endeavour	1
each	1
one	1
shouldering	1
and	1
pushing	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
his	1
eagerness	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
jonathan	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
quincey	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
forcing	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
bent	1
on	1
finishing	1
their	1
task	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
should	1
set	1
nothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
stop	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
hinder	1
them	1
neither	1
the	1
levelled	1
weapons	1
or	1
the	1
flashing	1
knives	1
of	1
the	1
gypsies	1
in	1
front	1
or	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
behind	1
appeared	1
to	1
even	1
attract	1
their	1
attention	1
jonathans	1
impetuosity	1
and	1
the	1
manifest	1
singleness	1
of	1
his	1
purpose	1
seemed	1
to	1
overawe	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
instinctively	1
they	1
cowered	1
aside	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
pass	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
had	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strength	1
which	1
seemed	1
incredible	1
raised	1
the	1
great	1
box	1
and	1
flung	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
wheel	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
mr	1
morris	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
use	1
force	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
his	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
szgany	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
breathlessly	1
watching	1
jonathan	1
i	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
my	1
eye	1
seen	1
him	1
pressing	1
desperately	1
forward	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
knives	1
of	1
the	1
gypsies	1
flash	1
as	1
he	1
won	1
a	1
way	1
through	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
cut	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
parried	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
bowie	1
knife	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
had	1
come	1
through	1
in	1
safety	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
sprang	1
beside	1
jonathan	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
jumped	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
spurting	1
through	1
his	1
fingers	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
delay	1
notwithstanding	1
this	1
for	1
as	1
jonathan	1
with	1
desperate	1
energy	1
attacked	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
chest	1
attempting	1
to	1
prize	1
off	1
the	1
lid	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
kukri	1
knife	1
he	1
attacked	1
the	1
other	1
frantically	1
with	1
his	1
bowie	1
under	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
both	1
men	1
the	1
lid	1
began	1
to	1
yield	1
the	1
nails	1
drew	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
screeching	1
sound	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
thrown	1
back	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
gypsies	1
seeing	1
themselves	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
winchesters	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
lord	1
godalming	1
and	1
dr	1
seward	1
had	1
given	1
in	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
further	1
resistance	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
almost	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
mountain	1
tops	1
and	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
group	1
fell	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
snow	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
count	1
lying	1
within	1
the	1
box	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
rude	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
had	1
scattered	1
over	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
deathly	1
pale	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
waxen	1
image	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
eyes	1
glared	1
with	1
the	1
horrible	1
vindictive	1
look	1
which	1
i	1
knew	1
too	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
the	1
eyes	1
saw	1
the	1
sinking	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
hate	1
in	1
them	1
turned	1
to	1
triumph	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
instant	1
came	1
the	1
sweep	1
and	1
flash	1
of	1
jonathans	1
great	1
knife	1
i	1
shrieked	1
as	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
shear	1
through	1
the	1
throat	1
whilst	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
mr	1
morriss	1
bowie	1
knife	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
miracle	1
but	1
before	1
our	1
very	1
eyes	1
and	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
breath	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
crumbled	1
into	1
dust	1
and	1
passed	1
from	1
our	1
sight	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
i	1
live	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
moment	1
of	1
final	1
dissolution	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
peace	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
might	1
have	1
rested	1
there	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
dracula	1
now	1
stood	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
red	1
sky	1
and	1
every	1
stone	1
of	1
its	1
broken	1
battlements	1
was	1
articulated	1
against	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
the	1
gypsies	1
taking	1
us	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
turned	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
rode	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
for	1
their	1
lives	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unmounted	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
leiterwagon	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
horsemen	1
not	1
to	1
desert	1
them	1
the	1
wolves	1
which	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
to	1
a	1
safe	1
distance	1
followed	1
in	1
their	1
wake	1
leaving	1
us	1
alone	1
mr	1
morris	1
who	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
pressed	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
the	1
blood	1
still	1
gushed	1
through	1
his	1
fingers	1
i	1
flew	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
circle	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
keep	1
me	1
back	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
two	1
doctors	1
jonathan	1
knelt	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
laid	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
a	1
feeble	1
effort	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
was	1
unstained	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
for	1
he	1
smiled	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
too	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
oh	1
god	1
he	1
cried	1
suddenly	1
struggling	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
sitting	1
posture	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
die	1
look	1
look	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
now	1
right	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
mountain	1
top	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
gleams	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
bathed	1
in	1
rosy	1
light	1
with	1
one	1
impulse	1
the	1
men	1
sank	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
and	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
earnest	1
amen	1
broke	1
from	1
all	1
as	1
their	1
eyes	1
followed	1

to	1
our	1
bitter	1
grief	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1

of	1
some	1

that	1
on	1

quincey	1

died	1
his	1
mother	1
holds	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
secret	1
belief	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
brave	1
friends	1
spirit	1
has	1
passed	1
into	1
him	1

bundle	1
of	1
names	1

all	1
our	1
little	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
together	1

we	1
call	1
him	1
quincey	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
we	1
made	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
transylvania	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
old	1
ground	1
which	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
us	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
vivid	1
and	1
terrible	1
memories	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
impossible	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
heard	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
ears	1
were	1
living	1
truths	1
every	1
trace	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
was	1
blotted	1
out	1
the	1
castle	1
stood	1
as	1
before	1
reared	1
high	1
above	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
desolation	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
home	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
time	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
all	1
look	1
back	1
on	1
without	1
despair	1
for	1
godalming	1

took	1
the	1

from	1

they	1
had	1
been	1
ever	1
since	1
our	1
return	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
we	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
